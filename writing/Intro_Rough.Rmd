# Part I - Urban Nature & Humans  
Most people experience nature through the lens of an urban landscape. Cities are
often considered to be hostile places with little to no natural elements. 
However, cities host an abundance of flora and fauna, often rivaling their 
natural counterparts in terms of biodiversity levels and species richness. Urban
nature can be found in many forms, including private yards, street trees, 
stormwater ponds, and other "green" and "blue" spaces throughout a city. 
In cities, natural elements are managed and often designed by humans. Nature 
coexists with built and natural infrastructure simultaneously. The way that 
the various stakeholders manage urban nature influences how the entire 
population experiences and interacts with it. For example, EXAMPLE (maybe gentrification?).  Further, our interactions with nature provide benefits such as improved physical 
health and a sense of belonging, as well as influencing our identity and lived 
experiences.  

# Part II - Ecosystem Services & Disservices  
Nature bestows many benefits and gifts on humans that interact with it, 
consciously or unconsciously. Often, the gifts that nature gives to humans are 
defined as "nature's contributions to people" or ecosystem services. However, 
nature's impacts are not always beneficial. For example, street trees often 
require maintenance and when that is not provided, they can become dangerous for 
residents. The negative impacts of nature on human lives are often referred to 
as ecosystem disservices. The urban landscape is a complex and dynamic system 
that is made up of many ecosystem services and disservices.  

Ecosystem services are often categorized into four main groups, provisioning 
services, regulating services, supporting services, and cultural services. In 
reality, many ecosystem services cross the boundaries of each group and can 
provide benefits in multiple categories. Provisioning services are defined as 
benefits that provide products from ecosystems, for example food provided 
through agriculture. Regulating services are defined as benefits that are 
obtained through the regulation of ecosystems, such as climate regulation from 
tree canopies. Supporting services are defined as services that are needed 
for overall ecosystem functioning, such as nutrient cycling. Finally, cultural 
services are defined as benefits obtained from ecosystems that are non-material 
in nature, for example, a sense of belonging. All four groups of ecosystem 
services provide different benefits to humans and all are required to improve 
quality of life.
