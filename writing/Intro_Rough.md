# Part I - Urban Nature & Humans  
Most people experience nature through the lens of an urban landscape. Cities are
often considered to be hostile places with little to no natural elements. 
However, cities host an abundance of flora and fauna, often rivaling their 
natural counterparts in terms of biodiversity levels and species richness. Urban
nature can be found in many forms, including private yards, street trees, 
stormwater ponds, and other "green" and "blue" spaces occurring in cities. 
In cities, natural elements are managed and often designed by humans. Nature 
coexists with built and natural infrastructure simultaneously.
