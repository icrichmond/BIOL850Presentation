# Part I - Urban Landscapes  

Urban landscapes are a complex combination of natural and built elements. The 
natural elements that make up our cities include flora, fauna,and natural structures
such as rivers and lakes. Built elements are infrastructure created 
by humans, such as buildings and roads, often referred to as "grey" 
infrastructure. Both natural and built elements benefit urban dwellers. Built 
infrastructure in cities is concentrated in a way that allows urban residents to 
fulfill many needs in a convenient way. For example, living in a city 
allows you to live, work, shop, and build community all within a relatively small 
area. Further, the natural elements of the city provide many benefits to urban 
dwellers. Most people experience nature through the lens of the urban landscape. 
Studies have shown that interaction with nature improves mental health and 
physical health, and is an important part of development. In addition, there are 
specific gifts and benefits that humans receive from nature, urban and non-urban, 
that we cannot receive from built elements. However, urban nature differs from 
non-urban nature in an important way, management.  

Everything in our cities is managed by humans, including nature. 
For example, the composition of the urban forest does not necessarily 
evolve naturally, in the same way you would expect a non-urban forest to evolve. 
Urban planners, residents, and developers all make decisions regarding the 
density and species of trees that make up the urban forest. Often, urban nature 
is being managed in a way that maximizes benefits to urban dwellers. Maximizing 
human benefit can look very different depending on the interested party.For example,
planners want to have low levels of maintenance and are often guided by 
ecologically determined "best practices" for planting, whereas residents may be 
trying to maximize benefits such as food production or aesthetic beauty. 
All management goals are valid and important, and managing urban nature to 
maximize benefits to all parties involved is an especially critical and 
difficult problem (has been referred to as a "wicked" problem @gaston2013).  

Cities in the Global North are not currently being designed or managed to maximize 
benefits to all rights- and stake-holders. Currently, we build and manage our 
cities under capitalist and settler-colonial systems. The prioritization of 
maximizing financial benefit to private businesses and individuals in combination with the 
legacy of settler-colonial ideals, mainly racism, has led to a deeply skewed and
inequitable distribution of urban benefits. Despite the hard and relentless work 
of many municipal government employees, activists, and NGOs to address the long-
standing inequities of urban nature's benefits, there are still extremely harmful
disparities in how the distribution, production, and delivery of urban nature's 
benefits occurs. For example, the "luxury effect" is  a well-tested theory in 
urban ecology that explains a large amount of variation in urban nature quantity 
and quality by using the socioeconomic status of the neighbourhoods in 
question. Further, urban parks provide many benefits to residents, including 
alleviating public health issues, and park area is negatively correlated with 
the proportion of BIPOC residents in the census tract in the United Stats [@hoover2020]. 
To maximize urban nature's benefits to the entire urban population, we need to 
critically engage with the prioritization of economic benefits and make our 
decisions based on other critera, such as equity, compassion, and justice.  


# Part II - Ecosystem Services & Disservices  
Managing urban nature to maximize benefits to all urban dwellers is a daunting 
task, however, an "ecosystem services" framework may allow us to attempt it. 
Nature bestows many benefits and gifts on humans that interact with it, 
consciously or unconsciously. Often, the gifts that nature gives to humans are 
defined as "nature's contributions to people" or ecosystem services. However, 
nature's impacts are not always beneficial. For example, street trees often 
require maintenance and when that is not provided, they can become dangerous for 
residents. The negative impacts of nature on human lives are often referred to 
as ecosystem disservices. The urban landscape is a complex and dynamic system 
that is made up of many ecosystem services and disservices.  



Ecosystem services are often categorized into four main groups, provisioning 
services, regulating services, supporting services, and cultural services. In 
reality, many ecosystem services cross the boundaries of each group and can 
provide benefits in multiple categories. Provisioning services are defined as 
benefits that provide products from ecosystems, for example food provided 
through agriculture. Regulating services are defined as benefits that are 
obtained through the regulation of ecosystems, such as climate regulation from 
tree canopies. Supporting services are defined as services that are needed 
for overall ecosystem functioning, such as nutrient cycling. Finally, cultural 
services are defined as benefits obtained from ecosystems that are non-material 
in nature, for example, a sense of belonging. All four groups of ecosystem 
services provide different benefits to humans and all are required to improve 
quality of life.
