  abstract = {Evaluating the impact that airborne contamination associated with Athabasca oil sands (AOS) mining operations has on the surrounding boreal forest ecosystem requires a rigorous approach to source discrimination. This study presents a century- long historical record of source apportionment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in dated sediments from two headwater lakes located approximately 40 and 55 km east from the main area of open pit mining activities. Concentrations of the 16 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) priority PAHs in addition to retene, dibenzothiophene (DBT), and six alkylated groups were measured, and both PAH molecular diagnostic ratios and carbon isotopic signatures ({$\delta$}13C) of individual PAHs were used to differentiate natural from anthropogenic inputs. Although concentrations of PAHs in these lakes were low and below the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) guidelines, diagnostic ratios pointed to an increasingly larger input of petroleum-derived (i.e., petrogenic) PAHs over the past 30 years concomitant with {$\delta$}13C values progressively shifting to the value of unprocessed AOS bitumen. This petrogenic source is attributed to the deposition of bitumen in dust particles associated with wind erosion from open pit mines. \ding{110}},

  abstract = {The past several decades have witnessed a significant expansion of mining activities in the Athabasca oil sands region, raising concerns about their impact on the surrounding boreal forest ecosystem. To better understand the extent to which distal sites are impacted by oil sands-derived airborne contaminants, we examine sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface sediments and dated sediment cores from Saskatchewan lakes situated \textasciitilde 100-220km east-northeast of the main area of bitumen mining activities. The concentrations and fluxes of both parent and alkylated PAHs are low and show considerable variability over the past 70-100years. Small yet discernible increases in PAH concentrations and fluxes occurred over the past 30years, a trend which coincides with the rapid growth in bitumen production. However, several lines of evidence point to wildfires as the principal source of PAHs to these lakes: (1) the significant co-variations in most cores between retene (1-methyl-7-isopropyl phenanthrene) and other groups of parent and alkylated PAHs, (2) the similarity in compound specific ??13C signatures of the parent PAHs phenanthrene and pyrene in recently deposited surficial sediments and those corresponding to time intervals considerably pre-dating the large scale development of the oil sands and (3) the discernible up-core increases in the proportion of refractory carbon (i.e., char) in Rock-Eval 6 data. The collective evidence points to softwood combustion from boreal forest fires as the principal source of retene in sediments and the general increase in forest fire activity in this region over the past several decades as the source of refractory carbon. Mining activities associated with the Athabasca oil sands are thus not considered a major source of PAHs to these lakes.},

We employed a variance partitioning analysis to quantify the relative role of lake characteristics, multiple-scaled land use (catchment, buffer zones of 100, 300 and 500 m), and space in explaining the composition and richness of functional macrophyte groups (emergent and submerged macrophytes and hydrophytes) and ecological status of macrophytes in 110 Finnish lakes. Partial redundancy analysis (community composition) and partial linear regression (richness and status index) revealed that macrophyte community composition, richness, and status index were mostly explained by the pure effect of lake characteristics, which dominated over space for most macrophyte variables. Land use adjacent to shoreline had a higher effect on emergent macrophytes and status index compared to the land use of the whole catchment. Our findings suggest that emergent macrophytes can indicate changes in water quality and hydro-morphology originated from the close vicinity of the littoral zone. Ecological quality assessment based on emergent macrophytes only is probably not sufficient, but including emergent species in the assessments is recommended, especially in the species-poor boreal region.},

This allows for effective conservation or management of partially migratory animal populations by identifying the appropriate size of management units and temporal interventions. However, this knowledge is often lacking as only a few individuals from a single population are tracked in space and time. To understand the drivers of intraspecific variation in movement patterns across a broad scale, we analyzed the multiannual space use of 307 moose (Alces alces), containing 544 single-year trajectories, from 10 study areas that are spread over a 1500-km latitudinal gradient. Using a novel approach, we quantified within-And among-population variation in movement and space use patterns. We identified the movement strategy (migratory, sedentary, nomadic, or dispersal) of moose and computed annual and seasonal home ranges. Individuals demonstrated variable movement strategies from migration to year-round residence. Summer home ranges were larger in northern study areas, whereas no geographical trends were detected among populations in winter home ranges. Individual-level traits, such as sex and age, along with factors related to the landscape, such as land use and habitat, explained variation within populations, whereas climatic factors such as temperature and vegetative productivity explained variation among populations. Importantly, the variables that explained individual-level variation in space use within populations were different for all our populations. We demonstrate the intricate interplay between individual life history and landscape scale variables and how they may determine the observed movementpatterns and influence the scale of management.},

Results of these assays showed the highest values when tannins (fraction 2) were tested. For instance, the TAA of the tannin fraction was 5.85 micromol Trolox eq./mg, whereas the crude extract and fraction 1 showed 0.68 and 0.33 micromol Trolox eq./mg, respectively. The content of total phenolics in fraction 2 was the highest (290 mg/g); the tannin content, determined using the vanillin method and expressed as absorbance units at 500 nm per 1 g, was 129. There were 24 compounds identified in the crude extract using an HPLC-ESI-MS method: quercetin diglycoside, catechin, digallate procyanidin, and p-hydroxybenzoic were the dominant phenolics in the extract.},

The Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES) literature offers new ways of measuring these aspects. In this study, we use geo-located social media data to assess the value attributed to CES in 18 urban parks in Barcelona, of which 9 were shown to have experienced green gentrification in previous studies. We performed descriptive analysis and statistical independence tests on 703 photos downloaded from the social media platform Flickr. Of the 703 photos analyzed, 85\% were taken in parks associated with green gentrification; nevertheless, around 80\% of all photos depicted built infrastructures rather than ecological features \textendash{} indicating that green gentrification is not strictly about greenness and how visitors value it. Statistical results show that parks that experienced green gentrification were significantly associated with ``aesthetics'' and ``recreational activities'', whilst parks that did not experience green gentrification were significantly associated with ``cultural identity'' and ``social activities''. These results suggest that justice outcomes following from the relationship between urban greening and gentrification are dependent on the social-cultural associations with green spaces that the ecosystem services framework formulates, making it a potentially powerful tool for understanding how to generate more just greening policies in cities.},

Although anaerobic communities were common, cores from oil sands and coal beds had unexpectedly high proportions of aerobic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. Likewise, most metagenomes had high proportions of genes for enzymes involved in aerobic hydrocarbon metabolism. Hence, although HREs may have been strictly anaerobic and typically methanogenic for much of their history, this may not hold today for coal beds and for the Alberta oil sands, one of the largest remaining oil reservoirs in the world.

Circuitscape.jl allows users to solve problems faster via improved parallel processing and solvers, and supports applications to larger problems (e.g., datasets with hundreds of millions of cells). We document speed improvements of up to 1800\textbackslash\%. We also demonstrate scaling of problem sizes up to 437 million grid cells. These improvements allow modelers to work with higher resolution data, larger landscapes and perform sensitivity analysis effortlessly. These improvements accelerate the pace of innovation, helping modelers address pressing challenges like species range shifts under climate change. Our collaboration between ecologists and computer scientists has led to the use of connectivity models to inform conservation decisions. Further, these next generation connectivity models will produce results faster, facilitating stronger engagement with decision-makers.},

Additionally, ES are being increasingly included in urban planning and management as a way to create multi-functional landscapes able to meet the needs of expanding urban populations. However, while ES are generated and utilized within landscapes we still have limited understanding of the relationship between ES and spatial structure and dynamics. Here, we offer an expanded conceptualization of these relationships through the concept of service providing units (SPUs) as a way to plan and manage the structures and preconditions that are needed for, and in different ways influence, provisioning of ES. The SPU approach has two parts: the first deals with internal dimensions of the SPUs themselves, i.e. spatial and temporal scale and organizational level, and the second outlines how context and presence of external structures (e.g. built infrastructure or larger ecosystems) affect the performance of SPUs. In doing so, SPUs enable a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to managing and designing multi-functional landscapes and achieving multiple ES goals.},

In southeast British Columbia, Canada, we applied DNA hair-trap sampling (1) to evaluate relationships of grizzly bear detections with landscape variables of habitat and human activity, and (2) to model the spatial distribution and abundance of grizzly bears. During 1996\textendash 1998, we sampled grizzly bear occur-rence across 5,496 km 2 at sites distributed according to grid cells. We compared 244 combinations of sampling sites and sessions where grizzly bears were detected (determined by nDNA analyses) to 845 site\textendash sessions where they were not. We tested for differences in 30 terrain, vegetation, land cover, and human influence variables at 3 spatial scales. Grizzly bears more often were detected in landscapes of relatively high elevation, steep slope, rugged ter-rain, and low human access and linear disturbance densities. These landscapes also were comprised of more avalanche chutes, alpine tundra, barren surfaces, burned forests, and less young and logged forests. Relationships with forest productivity and some overstory species were positive at broader scales, while associations with forest overstory and productivity were negative at the finest scale. At the finest scale, the strong negative association with very young, logged forests and with increasing values of the Landsat-derived green vegetation index became posi-tive when analyzed in a multivariate context. For multivariate analyses, we considered 2 variables together with 11 principal components that describe ecological gradients among 4 variable groupings. We applied multiple logistic regression and used AIC to rank and weight competing subset models. We derived coefficients for interpretation and prediction using multi-model inference. The resulting function was highly predictive, which we confirmed against an independent dataset. We transformed the output using a multi-annual population estimate for the sam-pling area, and we applied the resulting grizzly bear density and distribution model across our greater study area as a strategic-level planning tool. We discuss conservation applications and design considerations of this DNA-based approach for grizzly bears and other forest-dwelling species.

The first assumes that prey seek high resource patches and, subsequently, predators seek prey within these patches, and predicts a high degree of overlap in patch use by both. The second model assumes that predator and prey balance not only food resources but reciprocal levels of pre-dation risk and predation success in making decisions on whether or not to use a patch. This model predicts discordance in patch use between predator and prey. We used a combination of GPS-telemetry and camera-trapping data to assess habitat use patterns of predator and prey. Results from this study support the second model regarding spatial use of the landscape by a predator and its prey. Where the use of the landscape by predators and prey seem to be mediated by environmental constraints, both will adjust their predatory or antipredatory strategies based on these constraints. This results in a partial spatial separation of predator and prey across the landscape, providing patches of relative safety for prey but sufficient areas of overlap for predators to be successful. R\'esum\'e : Nous avons \'evalu\'e le degr\'e d'exclusivit\'e mutuelle des r\'epartitions dans le paysage du coyote (Canis latrans Say, 1823) et de ses principales proies (deux esp\`eces de lagomorphes : le li\`evre californien, Lepus californicus Gray, 1837, et le lapin d'Audubon, Sylvilagus audubonii (Baird, 1858)) en testant deux mod\`eles. Le premier de ces mod\`eles postule que les proies recherchent des secteurs riches en ressources et que, subs\'equemment, les pr\'edateurs cherchent leurs proies dans ces secteurs, et il pr\'edit un degr\'e \'elev\'e de chevauchement de l'utilisation des secteurs concern\'es par les proies et les pr\'edateurs. Le second mod\`ele postule que, dans leur prise de d\'ecisions quant \`a l'utilisation ou non d'un secteur, le pr\'edateur et la proie soup\`esent non seulement les ressources alimentaires pr\'esentes, mais \'egalement les degr\'es r\'eciproques de succ\`es de la pr\'eda-tion et de risque de pr\'edation. Ce mod\`ele pr\'edit une discordance entre l'utilisation de secteurs par les pr\'edateurs et les proies. Des donn\'ees de t\'el\'em\'etrie GPS et de pi\`ege photo ont \'et\'e utilis\'ees pour \'evaluer les patrons d'utilisation d'habitats de pr\'edateurs et de proies. Les r\'esultats de l'\'etude appuient le second mod\`ele d'utilisation spatiale du paysage par un pr\'edateur et sa proie. Ainsi, l'utilisation du paysage semble modul\'ee par des contraintes environnementales, les pr\'edateurs et les proies ajustant leurs strat\'egies (de pr\'edation et anti-pr\'edation, respectivement) en fonction de ces contraintes. Il s'ensuit une s\'epara-tion spatiale partielle des pr\'edateurs et des proies \`a l'\'echelle du paysage qui se traduit par la pr\'esence de secteurs o\`u les proies sont en relative s\'ecurit\'e, mais \'egalement de zones de chevauchement suffisantes pour permettre le succ\`es de la pr\'eda-tion.},

  abstract = {Connectivity among populations and habitats is important for a wide range of ecological processes. Understanding, preserving, and restoring connectivity in complex landscapes requires connectivity models and metrics that are reliable, efficient, and process based. We introduce a new class of ecological connectivity models based in electrical circuit theory. Although they have been applied in other disciplines, circuit-theoretic connectivity models are new to ecology. They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance, current, and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes (such as individual movement and gene flow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efficient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes, or landscapes with millions of raster cells. Here we review basic circuit theory, discuss relationships between circuit and random walk theories, and describe applications in ecology, evolution, and conservation. We provide examples of how circuit models can be used to predict movement patterns and fates of random walkers in complex landscapes and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning.},

  abstract = {Both for the plant-geographer and the ecologist it is of great importance to know if an area or a district is rich or poor from the point of view of vegetation. Often the lists of plants from different districts are quite incomparable owing to the different sizes of the areas investigated. The problem of comparing lists of flora from several districts of different size therefore is of great interest and many attempts have been made to solve the question. Most writers, however, have obtained no results except to confirm the well-known and obvious fact, that the larger the area taken the greater the number of species. In two recent papers (1, 2) I have tried to solve the question and have ventured to propose an empirical formula. The material sampled showed that this formula is correct for areas of such different sizes as square decimetres, square metres and hectares. As it is of great interest to know if the formula only holds for complexes of associations, floral districts, etc., or if it is also valid for pure communities, the summer of 1920 was used for collecting material from several (altogether 13) associations of different types all lying in the islands of Stockholm as described in Ocologische Studien'. The results are tabulated in the following table. In the left-hand column the area is given in square decimetres, the next column gives the mean values for the different areas as observed in the field, while the third column gives the values obtained by the formula. The last column gives the deviations between the calculated and observed values estimated as percentages of the former. It is easily seen that the values calculated and observed agree very well. Generally there is an increase in the deviation corresponding to increasing area. This depends on the fact that the values of the smaller areas are the average of a greater number of observations than those of the larger. As it is shown that the formula holds for all the values obtained from these communities and as these examples are picked out quite by chance it can be stated as a general rule that it holds for every association and as a consequence of this also for complexes of associations, formations, large areas, districts, etc.},

Physical properties and redox potentials determine the qualitative and quantitative differences in toxicity among inorganic mercury compounds, while the ability of MeHg to cross the blood-brain barrier accounts for its accumulation in the CNS and a clinical picture that is dominated by neurological disturbances.

  abstract = {Tropical forest functional diversity, which is a measure of the diversity of organismal interactions with the environment, is poorly understood despite its importance for linking evolutionary biology to ecosystem biogeochemistry. Functional diversity is reflected in functional traits such as the concentrations of diierent compounds in leaves or the density of leaf mass, which are related to plant activities such as plant defence, nutrient cycling, or growth. In the Amazonian lowlands, river movement and microtopography control nutrient mobility, which may influence functional trait distributions. Here we use airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy to develop maps of 16 forest canopy traits, throughout four large landscapes that harbour three common forest community types on the Madre de Dios and Tambopata rivers in southwestern Amazonia. Our maps, which are based on quantitative chemometric analysis of forest canopies with visible-to-near infrared (400-2,500 nm) spectroscopy, reveal substantial variation in canopy traits and their distributions within and among forested landscapes. Forest canopy trait distributions are arranged in a nested pattern, with location along rivers controlling trait variation between diierent landscapes, and microtopography controlling trait variation within landscapes. We suggest that processes of nutrient deposition and depletion drive increasing phosphorus limitation, and a corresponding increase in plant defence, in an eastward direction from the base of the Andes into the Amazon Basin.},

After addition of the mixture, the development of the microbial composition of Mix3 was monitored at three different times (35, 113, and 222~days) using fingerprinting method and dominant bacterial species were identified. In parallel, 14 bacteria were isolated after 113~days and identified. Degradation capacities for Mix3 and the isolated bacterial strains were characterized and compared. At day 113, we induced the expression of catabolic genes in Mix3 by adding the substrate mixture to resting cells and the metatranscriptome was analyzed. After addition of the substrate mixture, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria increased at day 222 while a shift between Rhodococcus and Mycobacterium was observed after 113~days. Mix3 was able to degrade 13 compounds completely, with partial degradation of isooctane and 2-ethylhexyl nitrate, but tert-butyl alcohol was not degraded. Rhodococcus wratislaviensis strain IFP 2016 isolated from Mix3 showed almost the same degradation capacities as Mix3: these results were not observed with the other isolated strains. Transcriptomic results revealed that Actinobacteria and in particular, Rhodococcus species, were major contributors in terms of total and catabolic gene transcripts while other species were involved in cyclohexane degradation. Not all the microorganisms identified at day 113 were active except R. wratislaviensis IFP 2016 that appeared to be a major player in the degradation activity observed in Mix3.},

Societal factors such as resident preferences for tree traits, nursery offerings, and neighborhood characteristics are potentially key drivers of urban tree community composition and diversity, however, they remain critically understudied. We investigated patterns of urban tree structure in residential neighborhoods of the Salt Lake Valley, Utah, combining biological variables, such as neighborhood and plant nursery tree species and trait composition, and sociological data comprised of resident surveys and U.S. Census data. We sampled nine neighborhoods that varied in household income and age of homes. We found more tree species were offered in locally owned nurseries compared with mass merchandiser stores and yard trees at private residences were more diverse than public street trees in the same neighborhoods. There were significant differences among neighborhoods in street and yard tree composition. Newer neighborhoods differed from older neighborhoods in street tree species composition and trait diversity, while neighborhoods varying in affluence differed in yard tree composition. Species richness of yard trees was positively correlated with neighborhood household income, while species richness of street trees was negatively correlated with home age of neighborhood residences. Tree traits differed across neighborhoods of varying ages, suggesting different tree availability and preferences over time. Last, there was a positive correlation between resident preferences for tree attributes and the number of trees that had those attributes both in residential yards and in nursery offerings. Strong relationships between social variables and urban tree composition provides evidence that resident preferences and nursery offerings affect patterns of biodiversity in cities across Salt Lake Valley. These findings can be applied toward efforts to increase taxonomic and functional diversity of city trees in semiarid regions in ways that will also provide ecosystem services of most interest to residents.},

  abstract = {Connectivity is classically considered an emergent property of landscapes encapsulating individuals' flows across space. However, its operational use requires a precise understanding of why and how organisms disperse. Such movements, and hence landscape connectivity, will obviously vary according to both organism properties and landscape features. We review whether landscape connectivity estimates could gain in both precision and generality by incorporating three fundamental outcomes of dispersal theory. Firstly, dispersal is a multi-causal process; its restriction to an `escape reaction' to environmental unsuitability is an oversimplification, as dispersing individuals can leave excellent quality habitat patches or stay in poor-quality habitats according to the relative costs and benefits of dispersal and philopatry. Secondly, species, populations and individuals do not always react similarly to those cues that trigger dispersal, which sometimes results in contrasting dispersal strategies. Finally, dispersal is a major component of fitness and is thus under strong selective pressures, which could generate rapid adaptations of dispersal strategies. Such evolutionary responses will entail spatiotemporal variation in landscape connectivity. We thus strongly recommend the use of genetic tools to: (i) assess gene flow intensity and direction among populations in a given landscape; and (ii) accurately estimate landscape features impacting gene flow, and hence landscape connectivity. Such approaches will provide the basic data for planning corridors or stepping stones aiming at (re)connecting local populations of a given species in a given landscape. This strategy is clearly species- and landscape-specific. But we suggest that the ecological network in a given landscape could be designed by stacking up such linkages designed for several species living in different ecosystems. This procedure relies on the use of umbrella species that are representative of other species living in the same ecosystem.},

Here, we provide a multi-species analysis using generalized linear mixed models to examine the effects of local and regional variables on richness and occurrence rates of Odonata (dragonfly and damselfly) species at 81 sites throughout central California and north-western Nevada, USA. These study sites were located across a range of ecoregions, including the Sierra Nevada Forests, California Mediterranean, Great Basin Shrub Steppe, and Northern Coastal California Forests. Dynamic regional variables in this study, degree-days and precipi-tation, influenced the richness of dragonflies, but not the less-mobile damselflies. In contrast, local habitat type influenced the richness of damselflies, but not dragonflies. Overall species occurrence was higher during site visits with higher degree-days, especially for highly mobile groups including dragonflies and migratory species. Drag-onflies were also positively associated with total precipi-tation, but migratory species were not. Probability of presence across species was lower in highly urban sites, particularly for habitat specialists. Further, habitat spe-cialists had lower rates of occurrence overall, suggesting that widespread generalist species may increasingly dom-inate Odonata assemblages. Our study indicates that Odo-nata in this semi-arid region are responsive to a combination of local and regional environmental variables.},

We examined case studies of youth-focused community and citizen science (CCS) and analyzed the learning processes and outcomes, and stewardship activities for youth, as well as contributions to site and species management, each as conservation outcomes. Examining two programs (one coastal and one water quality monitoring) across multiple sites in the San Francisco Bay Area, CA, in- and out-of-school settings, we qualitatively analyzed in-depth observations and pre- and post-program interviews with youth and educators. First, we examined evidence from the programs' impacts on conservation in the form of contribution to site and species management. We found that youth work informed regional resource management and local habitat improvement. Second, we examined the youth participants' environmental science agency (ESA). ESA combines not only understanding of environmental science and inquiry practices, but also the youths' identification with those practices and their developing belief that the ecosystem is something on which they act. We found that youth developed different aspects of environmental science agency in each context. We identify three key CCS processes through which many of the youth developed ESA: ensuring rigorous data collection, disseminating scientific findings to authentic external audiences, and investigating complex social-ecological systems. Our findings suggest that when CCS programs for youth support these processes, they can foster youth participation in current conservation actions, and build their capacity for future conservation actions.},

Building on over 100~years of amateur naturalist contributions to biodiversity science, a wide range of NHM-based citizen science programs have emerged recently. Yet no comparative studies of the conservation outcomes of this work exist. Here we ask, what is the evidence that NHM citizen science contributes to conservation, what kinds of programs and strategies do so, and how could this approach be better realized for conservation goals? We analyzed 44 citizen science programs across three museums (one U.K., two U.S.) to assess whether and how they contribute to conservation-relevant outcomes. We found evidence that they support conservation both directly, through site and species management, and indirectly through research, education and policy impacts. This study has implications for understanding the role NHMs can play in maximizing the socio-ecological impacts of citizen science, including bringing citizen science to new audiences, mobilizing volunteers to collect and analyze data to study species invasions and impacts of global changes, and conducting locally-relevant research in urban systems. NHM citizen science can provide multiple entry-points and levels of engagement for participants in science and access to new means of studying biodiversity, both in the field and virtually. From our findings we recommend collaboration among the research and education staff within NHMs and other similar conservation organizations, as well as partnerships with external organizations to successfully contribute to conservation outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Models are commonly used to identify lands that will best maintain the ability of wildlife to move between wildland blocks through matrix lands after the remaining matrix has become incompatible with wildlife movement. We offer a roadmap of 16 choices and assumptions that arise in designing linkages to facilitate movement or gene flow of focal species between 2 or more predefined wildland blocks. We recommend designing linkages to serve multiple (rather than one) focal species likely to serve as a collective umbrella for all native species and ecological processes, explicitly acknowledging untested assumptions, and using uncertainty analysis to illustrate potential effects of model uncertainty. Such uncertainty is best displayed to stakeholders as maps of modeled linkages under different assumptions. We also recommend modeling corridor dwellers (species that require more than one generation to move their genes between wildland blocks) differently from passage species (for which an individual can move between wildland blocks within a few weeks). We identify a problem, which we call the subjective translation problem, that arises because the analyst must subjectively decide how to translate measurements of resource selection into resistance. This problem can be overcome by estimating resistance from observations of animal movement, genetic distances, or interpatch movements. There is room for substantial improvement in the procedures used to design linkages robust to climate change and in tools that allow stakeholders to compare an optimal linkage design to alternative designs that minimize costs or achieve other conservation goals.},

Because snails, salamanders, and plants play essential roles in the Ca cycle of northern hardwood forests, we hypothesized that their community diversity, abundance, and structure would vary with differences in biotic Ca availability. To test this hypothesis, we sampled 12 upland hardwood forests representing a soil Ca gradient in the Adirondack Mountains, New York (USA), where chronic deposition has resulted in acidified soils but where areas of well-buffered soils remain Ca rich due to parent materials. Along the gradient of increasing soil [Ca2+], we observed increasing trends in snail community richness and abundance, live biomass of redback salamanders (Plethodon cinereus (Green, 1818)), and canopy tree basal area. Salamander communities were dominated by mountain dusky salamanders (Desmognathus ochrophaeus Cope, 1859) at Ca-poor sites and changed continuously along the Ca gradient to become dominated by redback salamanders at the Ca-rich sites. Several known calciphilic species of snails and plants were found only at the highest-Ca sites. Our results indicated that Ca availability, which is shaped by geology and acidic deposition inputs, influences northern hardwood forest ecosystems at multiple trophic levels, although the underlying mechanisms require further study.},

  abstract = {The recognition of behavior as a link between process and pattern in landscape ecology is exemplified by the concept of functional connectivity: the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among resource patches. In this paper, I first argue that the actual operational definitions of this concept as applied to animal movement are not fully consistent with its formal definition. For instance, I question that a high likelihood of movement among the different points of primary habitat implies a high connectivity and contend that such a view can lead to misinterpretations. I also address two more hurdles to the measurement of functional connectivity: the fact that functional connectivity may not be equal along all axes and directions of movement and individual variation in functional connectivity within a given landscape. These points bring me to suggest that the concept of functional connectivity be bridged to the one of travel costs used in behavioral ecology. This would help define unequivocal operational definitions of functional connectivity as its measurement would then be dictated by its ecological role within specific models (e.g., travel costs within group membership models of foraging theory). I argue further that this ecological role shall in turn determine the motivation underlying the movement of individuals, implying that the latter should preferably be standardized when measuring functional connectivity in the field. I finally present some methods to do so. These include translocation and playback experiments, food-titration and giving-up densities experiments, and manipulating feeding and breeding site locations and success.},

Whereas a greater range of chemical classes has been demonstrated to display phototoxicity against insects, considerably more information is available on symptomology of phototoxicity and mechanisms of action in mammals. The commonalities include alterations in behavior following ingestion, notably photophobia, disruption of integumentary integrity following contact or ingestion, and metabolic detoxification following ingestion, in the case of furanocoumarins involving cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Not yet known to exist in insects are phototoxin-mediated effects on sensory (particularly visual) systems and phototoxicity resulting from abnormal chlorophyll metabolism.

  title = {Abundance of Macrofauna in Dense Seagrass Is Due to Habitat Preference, Not Predation},
  author = {Beu, Johann D and Westoby, Mark},
  year = {1986},
  volume = {68},
  pages = {205--209},
  abstract = {Two main hypotheses compete to explain why prey abundance decreases when seagrass density is reduced. One proposes that predators are more successful amongst seagrass of lower density; the other invokes habitat choice by prey. We reduced the density of seagrass in the presence, and in the absence, of predators in a field experiment to discriminate between these hypotheses. When seagrass was manipulated abundances of all six prey species decreased simultaneously both in the presence and in the absence of predators. We conclude that correlations of prey abundance and shoot density within a seagrass bed are proximately due to habitat preference of dense seagrass by prey. We report another experiment which supports this conclusion and shows that habitat preference is exercised at the earliest opportunity. However, the habitat preferences may have been selected by predation pressure. Laboratory studies show that predation rates in vegetated aquatic systems are lower in structurally complex habitats (Vince et al. 1976; Nelson 1979; Coen et al. 1981; Heck and Thoman 1981; Crowder and Cooper 1982; Savino and Stein 1982; Stoner 1982; Coull and Wells 1983). This has led to the hypothesis that predation is the proximate cause of correlations between prey abundance and structural complexity of seagrass (Nelson 1979; Heck and Orth 1980; Stoner 1982). However, habitat preferences could be responsible. Stoner (1980) showed that amphipods discriminate between seagrass of different complexity. Moreover, if survival is increased amongst seagrass with better cover then preference for that habitat would be selected (Stoner 1980, 1983; Bell and Westoby, MS). Past research does not make it clear whether predation or habitat preference is the immediate cause of macrofauna distributions in seagrass. When predators have been excluded , or included, under field conditions, prey abundances have often failed to alter as predicted by laboratory experiments (Young et al. 1977; Young and Young 1978; Nelson 1981; Summerson and Peterson 1984). In a previous field study (Bell and Westoby, MS) we recorded decreases in abundance of prey, such as small fishes and decapods, when we reduced density of the sea-grass, Zostera capricorni. Here we report similar field experiments modified to show whether predation or habitat choice caused the response. We asked 1) Are negative re-Offprint requests to." J.D. Bell sponses of prey abundance to reduced density of seagrass repeatable? 2) Do such responses still occur when predators are excluded from seagrass of low density? The first experiment showed that negative responses to reduced seagrass were repeatable and that predators were not responsible. Therefore we ran a second experiment to confirm that prey move in response to such changes in their habitat. First experiment This field experiment tested for repeatability of responses by prey to reductions in seagrass density, and the cause of these responses. It was carried out in the large (\textasciitilde 33 ha), subtidal bed of Zostera capricorni that we worked in one year earlier (Bell and Westoby, MS). This bed is located on the northern shore of Botany Bay, New South Wales, Australia (34 \textasciitilde{} 0'S, 151 \textasciitilde{} 11'E). Methods Species involved. Species used were the gobiid fish Bathygo-bius kreJfti, the carid shrimps Alpheus pacificus and Alpheus leviusculus and the small portunid crabs Nectocarcinus tu-berculosus and Thalamita sima. These species showed a significant decrease in abundance when density of Zostera was reduced (Bell and Westoby, MS). In this study we have also analysed data for the carid shrimp Macrobrachium in-termedium. It showed a threefold decrease in abundance in response to reduction of Zostera density in our previous study, but was not abundant enough for meaningful statistical analysis at that time. All species are among the prey of fish, octopus or large portunid crabs occurring at our study site (Bell 1980, Burchmore 1982, pers. observ.). Experimental design. Between 15 and 19 November 1983 we established five 6 x 6 m blocks, each separated by 75 m, within the Zostera bed. Blocks were divided into four plots, each of 3 x 3 m. Densities of shoots were thinned in three plots. Of these, one had open access to predators (T), one had predators excluded (T-P) and one had an exclusion cage open to predators (T + CP). The fourth plot remained as dense (untreated) seagrass (D). The D and T plots provided a test for question 1), whereas comparisons of plots T, T-P and D were necessary to answer question 2). The T + CP plot provided a control for any effects of the predator exclusion cage.},

  abstract = {The forage-maturation hypothesis (FMH) states that herbivores migrate along a phenological gradient of plant development in order to maximize energy intake. Despite strong support for the FMH, the actual relationship between plant phenology and ungulate movement has remained enigmatic. We linked plant phenology (MODIS-normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI] data) and space use of 167 migratory and 78 resident red deer (Cervus elaphus), using a space-time-time matrix of "springness," defined as the instantaneous rate of green-up. Consistent with the FMH, migrants experienced substantially greater access to early plant phenology than did residents. Deer were also more likely to migrate in areas where migration led to greater gains in springness. Rather than "surfing the green wave" during migration, migratory red deer moved rapidly from the winter to the summer range, thereby "jumping the green wave." However, migrants and, to a lesser degree, residents did track phenological green-up through parts of the growing season by making smaller-scale adjustments in habitat use. Despite pronounced differences in their life histories, we found only marginal differences between male and female red deer in this study. Those differences that we did detect pointed toward additional constraints on female space-use tactics, such as those posed by calving and caring for dependent offspring. We conclude that whereas in some systems migration itself is a way to surf the green wave, in others it may simply be a means to reconnect with phenological spring at the summer range. In the light of ubiquitous anthropogenic environmental change, understanding the relationship between the green wave and ungulate space use has important consequences for the management and conservation of migratory ungulates and the phenomenon of migration itself.},

Selection of protective cover was strongest for reproducing females, likely reflecting the need to protect young. Males showed strong selection for habitat types with high quality forage, possibly due to higher energy requirements. Selection for preferred habitat types providing food and cover was a positive function of their availability within home ranges (i.e. not proportional use) indicating functional response in habitat selection. This relationship was not found for unproductive habitat types. Moreover, home ranges with high cover of unproductive habitat types were larger, and smaller home ranges contained higher proportions of the most preferred habitat type. The distribution of moose within the study area was partly related to the distribution of different habitat types. Our study shows how distribution and availability of habitat types providing cover and high-quality food shape ungulate habitat selection and space use.},

  abstract = {Landscapes of Fear (LOF), the spatially explicit distribution of perceived predation risk as seen by a population, is increasingly cited in ecological literature and has become a frequently used "buzz-word". With the increase in popularity, it became necessary to clarify the definition for the term, suggest boundaries and propose a common framework for its use. The LOF, as a progeny of the "ecology of fear" conceptual framework, defines fear as the strategic manifestation of the cost-benefit analysis of food and safety tradeoffs. In addition to direct predation risk, the LOF is affected by individuals' energetic-state, inter- and intra-specific competition and is constrained by the evolutionary history of each species. Herein, based on current applications of the LOF conceptual framework, I suggest the future research in this framework will be directed towards: (1) finding applied management uses as a trait defining a population's habitat-use and habitat-suitability; (2) studying multi-dimensional distribution of risk-assessment through time and space; (3) studying variability between individuals within a population; (4) measuring eco-neurological implications of risk as a feature of environmental heterogeneity and (5) expanding temporal and spatial scales of empirical studies.},

  abstract = {In the last decade compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) has evolved as a valuable technique in the field of environmental science, especially in contaminated site assessment. Instrumentation and methods exist for highly precise measurements of the isotopic composition of organic contaminants even in a very low concentration range. Nevertheless, the determination of precise and accurate isotope data of environmental samples can be a challenge. Since CSIA is gaining more and more popularity in the assessment of in situ biodegradation of organic contaminants, an increasing number of authorities and environmental consulting offices are interested in the application of the method for contaminated site remediation. Because of this, it is important to demonstrate the problems and limitations associated with compound-specific isotope measurements of environmental samples. In this review, potential pitfalls of the analytical procedure are critically discussed and strategies to avoid possible sources of error are provided. In order to maintain the analytical quality and to ensure the basis for reliable stable isotope data, recommendations on groundwater sampling, and sample preservation and storage are given. Important aspects of sample preparation and preconcentration techniques to improve sensitivity are highlighted. Problems related to chromatographic resolution and matrix interference are discussed that have to be considered in order to achieve accurate gas chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry measurements. As a result, the need for a thorough investigation of compound-specific isotope fractionation effects introduced by any step of the overall analytical method by standards with known isotopic composition is emphasized. Finally, we address some important points that have to be considered when interpreting data from field investigations.},

We used an individual-based model to simulate grizzly bear responses to: 1) region-level management practices represented by ownership patterns, and 2) watershed-level changes in habitat availabili-ty due to proposed harvests and road building. We assigned permeabilities (i.e., values that represent how easily a bear can move through a patch) to ownership blocks (region-level) and habitat patches (watershed-level) based upon a literature review, and used a correlated random-walk diffusion model to simulate movements. Simulated bears were placed into rasterized landscapes in a stratified random manner. At the regional level, bears moved {$<$} 1500 times (i.e., = 1530 km), and their destinations were tallied. At the watershed level, the number of moves required for bears to leave the watershed were tallied. Sensitivity analyses were used to determine the variability of the results'with respect to changes in some parameters of interest (i.e., permeabilities of private lands, harvest per-meabilities, and disturbance indices). With the permeability of private land set at 50 (range: 0 to 99), simulated grizzlies did not disperse from the Scapegoat and Bob Marshall Wildernesses into Yellowstone National Park (0 of 10000 simulated individuals). Under the assumptions of this model, a linkage between the wildernesses in northern Montana and Yellow-stone does not appear to exist. However, a significant number of simulated grizzlies (41\%) dispersed from Anaconda Pintler Wilderness, which is near Trail Creek Watershed, into the wilderness ES in eastern Idaho. A linkage may exist between these sites. At the watershed-level, removal of forest habitat under proposed Harvest I (1.77\% of the watershed cut) led to simulated grizzlies using slightly more moves (i.e., {$<$} 5.6\%, P = 0.042) to exit the watershed than under existing conditions. Harvests of 3.5\% of the watershed (planned Harvest II) did not alter the number of moves required to exit the watershed (P = 0.068). When disturbances associated with roads and harvests were also examined, large increases in number of movements required to exit the watershed occurred ({$<$} 151\%, P = 0.002). These analyses suggest that grizzly bears would be disturbed while timber harvests were ongoing, but that long-term changes in movement would not occur if roads were closed following harvests. The analyses demonstrate the utility of apply-ing individual-based diffusion models to landscape-level movements of animals, and identifies the need for teleme-try studies to determine movement rates through specific habitats.},

  abstract = {Synthesis The tissue chemistry of plants can influence ecosystem processes including growth, herbivory, and decomposition. Our comparison of nitrogen and phosphorus in over 1700 autotroph taxa demonstrates that latitudinal trends in tissue chemistry are consistent across non-vascular and vascular species in freshwater, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems. Tissue chemistry varies most within species and taxonomic lineages, yet the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio within individuals is strikingly similar among species in different ecosystems. These results shed new light on existing hypotheses, suggesting that light (e.g. photon flux) and growing season duration are primary drivers of latitudinal gradients in tissue chemistry, but providing little support for temperature, nutrient supply, or soil substrate age. Photoautotroph nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) tissue concentrations can influence ecosystem function via processes including growth, decomposition, and consumption, and may reflect traits maintaining coexistence. Studies in terrestrial systems have led to hypotheses that latitudinal trends in the N and P content of leaves may be driven by soil substrate age, environmental temperature, or season length; however, terrestrial patterns alone cannot differentiate these mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that broad geographical patterns of N and P in freshwater and marine multicellular photoautotrophs are concordant with those in terrestrial ecosystems. Our {$>$} 6800 record database reveals that mean tissue N and P increase with latitude in all ecosystems, but P increases more rapidly, causing N:P to decline; mean N:P scaling within individuals also is identical among systems, despite very different evolutionary environments. A partitioning of the variance in these data suggests that species composition and local environmental context likely lead to the variation observed within a latitudinal band. However, the consistency of trends in photosynthetic tissue chemistry across Earth's ecosystems suggests that biogeographical gradients in insolation and growing season length may constrain tissue N and P, whereas global trends in temperature, nutrient supply, and soil substrate age are unlikely to generate the consistent latitudinal trends among ecosystems. Thus, this cross-ecosystem comparison suggests a new hypothesis, global patterns of insolation, while also providing a new perspective on other mechanisms that have been hypothesized to underlie latitudinal trends in photosynthetic tissue chemistry. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.},

  abstract = {1. The content and ratio of nutrients in plants can be constrained by a wide array of factors, including nutrient supply, light intensity, herbivory, infection or intrinsic growth rate and can, in turn, affect many ecosystem processes including photosynthesis, decomposition, resource limitation and nutrient cycling. Studies of plant stoichiometry and stoichiometric homeostasis have focused primarily on the role of nutrient supply as a constraint on plant tissue chemistry, yet recent work suggests that local plant diversity, plant species composition and consumers may change the nutrient composition of whole plant communities. 2. By experimentally removing insects, foliar fungi and soil fungi from a long-term experiment manipulating plant diversity, we found that the foliar stoichiometry of individual plant species depends on biotic context. 3. Local plant diversity and the composition of the consumer community each altered foliar tissue carbon and nutrient chemistry of four different grassland species. The greatest impacts of consumers on foliar chemistry occurred at low plant diversity, and these changes induced by altering the food web were of a similar magnitude to the effects of fertilization or drought found in previous work. Consumers and plant diversity acted primarily on foliar carbon and nitrogen, whereas changes in foliar phosphorus were associated with the productivity of the local plant community. Thus, changes in whole-community stoichiometry that have been documented in response to alterations of the consumer food web or plant community are underlain by stoichiometric changes in individual species as well as plant species compositional changes. 4. Synthesis. These results suggest a new pathway by which loss of consumer or plant diversity may significantly impact the wide variety of ecosystem processes that depend on foliar nutrient content.},

  abstract = {1. Although the home range is a fundamental ecological concept, there is considerable debate over how it is best measured. There is a substantial literature concerning the precision and accuracy of all commonly used home range estimation methods; however, there has been considerably less work concerning how estimates vary with sampling regime, and how this affects statistical inferences. 2. We propose a new procedure, based on a variance components analysis using generalized mixed effects models to examine how estimates vary with sampling regime. 3. To demonstrate the method we analyse data from one study of 32 individually marked roe deer and another study of 21 individually marked kestrels. We subsampled these data to simulate increasingly less intense sampling regimes, and compared the performance of two kernel density estimation (KDE) methods, of the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and of the bivariate ellipse methods. 4. Variation between individuals and study areas contributed most to the total variance in home range size. Contrary to recent concerns over reliability, both KDE methods were remarkably efficient, robust and unbiased: 10 fixes per month, if collected over a standardized number of days, were sufficient for accurate estimates of home range size. However, the commonly used 95\% isopleth should be avoided; we recommend using isopleths between 90 and 50\%. 5. Using the same number of fixes does not guarantee unbiased home range estimates: statistical inferences differ with the number of days sampled, even if using KDE methods. 6. The MCP method was highly inefficient and results were subject to considerable and unpredictable biases. The bivariate ellipse was not the most reliable method at low sample sizes. 7. We conclude that effort should be directed at marking more individuals monitored over long periods at the expense of the sampling rate per individual. Statistical results are reliable only if the whole sampling regime is standardized. We derive practical guidelines for field studies and data analysis. \textcopyright{} 2006 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Extensive research confirms that environmental stressors like predation risk can profoundly affect animal condition and physiology. However, there is a lack of experimental research assessing the suite of physiological responses to risk that may arise under realistic field conditions, leaving a fragmented picture of risk-related physiological change and potential downstream consequences on individuals. We increased predation risk in free-ranging snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) during two consecutive summers by simulating natural chases using a model predator and monitored hares intensively via radio-telemetry and physiological assays, including measures designed to assess changes in stress physiology and overall condition. Compared to controls, risk-augmented hares had 25.8\% higher free plasma cortisol, 15.9\% lower cortisol-binding capacity, a greater neutrophil:lymphocyte skew, and a 10.4\% increase in glucose. Despite these changes, intra-annual changes in two distinct condition indices, were unaffected by risk exposure. We infer risk-augmented hares compensated for changes in their stress physiology through either compensatory foraging and/or metabolic changes, which allowed them to have comparable condition to controls. Although differences between controls and risk-augmented hares were consistent each year, both groups had heightened stress measures during the second summer, likely reflecting an increase in natural stressors (i.e., predators) in the environment. We show that increased predation risk in free-ranging animals can profoundly alter stress physiology and that compensatory responses may contribute to limiting effects of such changes on condition. Ultimately, our results also highlight the importance of biologically relevant experimental risk manipulations in the wild as a means of assessing physiological responses to natural stressors.},

Despite conservation and rehabilitation plans, populations of this species are dramatically declining due to human impacts such as habitat fragmentation, overfishing and water pollution. Owing to their large body size, anadromous adults were historically invulnerable to fish predation during their spawning period migration. This invulnerability has disappeared in Western Europe with the introduction of a new freshwater predator, the European catfish (Silurus glanis). Here we report how adults of Atlantic salmon are predated in the fishway of a large river of SW France, where the delayed and narrow passage created by the structure increases the probability of predator-prey encounter. We assessed predation risk by monitoring salmon and catfish in one fishway of the River Garonne, using video fish-counting from 1993 to 2016. We analysed the predation strategy of catfish using observations made with acoustic camera and RFID telemetry in 2016. Our results demonstrate a high predation rate (35\%\textemdash 14/39 ind.) on salmon inside the fishway during the 2016 spawning period migration. Our results suggest that a few specialized catfish individuals adapted their hunting behaviour to such prey, including their presence synchronized with that of salmon (i.e, more occurrences by the end of the day). Such results suggest that the spread of European catfish will potentially impact migration of anadromous species through anthropized systems.},

Our study examined how anthropogenic disturbance, habitat characteristics and hair cortisol concentrations interpreted as a sex-specific indicator of potential habitat net-energy demand affect the body condition of grizzly bears (n = 163) in a threatened population in Alberta, Canada. We quantified environmental variables by modelling spatial patterns of individual habitat use based on global positioning system telemetry data. After controlling for gender, age and capture effects, we assessed the influence of biological and environmental variables on body condition using linear mixed-effects models in an information theoretical approach. Our strongest model suggested that body condition was improved when patterns of habitat use included greater vegetation productivity, increased influence of forest harvest blocks and oil and gas well sites, and a higher percentage of regenerating and coniferous forest. However, body condition was negatively affected by habitat use in close proximity to roads and in areas where potential energetic demands were high. Poor body condition was also associated with increased selection of parks and protected areas and greater seasonal vegetation productivity. Adult females, females with cubs-of-year, juvenile females and juvenile males were in poorer body condition compared with adult males, suggesting that intra-specific competition and differences in habitat use based on gender and age may influence body condition dynamics. Habitat net-energy demand also tended to be higher in areas used by females which, combined with observed trends in body condition, could affect reproductive success in this threatened population. Our results highlight the importance of considering spatiotemporal variability in environmental factors and habitat use when assessing the body condition of individuals. Long-term and large-scale monitoring of the physiological state of individuals provides a more comprehensive approach to support management and conservation of species at risk.},

However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting arthropod communities, and the extent to which they facilitate connectivity of these communities within the urban environment is currently largely unknown. We investigated the variation of species community composition (beta diversity) of four arthropod groups with contrasting mobility (Carabidae, Araneae, Curculionidae, and Apidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 extensively managed green sites on the ground in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. With redundancy analysis and variation partitioning, we (1) disentangled the relative importance of local environmental conditions, the surrounding land cover composition, and habitat connectivity on species community composition, (2) searched for specific spatial scales of habitat connectivity for the different arthropod groups, and (3) discussed the ecological and functional value of green roofs in cities. Our study revealed that on green roofs community composition of high-mobility arthropod groups (bees and weevils) were mainly shaped by habitat connectivity, while low-mobility arthropod groups (carabids and spiders) were more influenced by local environmental conditions. A similar but less pronounced pattern was found for ground communities. The high importance of habitat connectivity in shaping high-mobility species community composition indicates that these green roof communities are substantially connected by the frequent exchange of individuals among surrounding green roofs. On the other hand, low-mobility species communities on green roofs are more likely connected to ground sites than to other green roofs. The integration of green roofs in urban spatial planning strategies has great potential to enable higher connectivity among green spaces, so that eventually even communities of low-mobility species become connected. Furthermore, improving the design of green roofs (composition and configuration of vegetation and soil types) could enhance the ecological value, particularly for low-mobility species.},

Using meta-analysis of 118 field and laboratory experiments in freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems, we tested hypotheses about co-limitation of N and P by comparing the effects of adding N alone, P alone, and both N and P together on internal N (e.g. \%N, C:N) and P (e.g. \%P, C:P) concentrations in autotroph communities. In particular, we tested the following predictions. First, if only one nutrient was limiting, addition of that nutrient should decrease the concentration of the other nutrient, but addition of the non-limiting nutrient would have no effect on the internal concentration of the limiting nutrient. If community co-limitation was occurring then addition of either nutrient should result in a decrease in the internal concentration of the other nutrient. Community co-limitation could also result in no change - or even an increase - in N concentrations in response to P addition if P stimulated growth of N fixers. Finally, if biochemically dependent co-limitation was occurring, addition of a limiting nutrient would not decrease, and could even increase, the concentration of the other, co-limited nutrient. We found no general evidence for the decrease in the internal concentration of one nutrient due to addition of another nutrient. The one exception to this overall pattern was marine systems, where N addition decreased internal P concentrations. In contrast, P addition increased internal N concentrations across all experiments, consistent with co-limitation. These results have important implications for understanding the roles that N and P play in controlling producer growth and internal nutrient accumulation as well as for managing the effects of nutrient enrichment in ecosystems. Synthesis On a global scale, humans have doubled nitrogen (N) inputs and quadrupled phosphorus (P) inputs relative to pre-industrial levels. N and P fertilization influences autotroph internal nutrient concentrations and ratios and thereby affects a variety of community and ecosystem processes, including decomposition and consumer population dynamics. It is therefore critical to understand the effects of nutrient additions on the growth and nutrient concentrations of primary producers. We used meta-analysis to evaluate the responses of autotroph internal N and P concentrations to additions of N, P, and N+P and make inferences about limitation and co-limitation of N and P across marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems. We found little evidence for single-nutrient limitation, highlighting the fact that multiple nutrients generally limit primary production.},

  abstract = {Nutrient limitation determines the primary production and species composition of many ecosystems. Here we apply an adaptive dynamics approach to investigate evolution of the ecological stoichiometry of primary producers and its implications for plant-herbivore interactions. The model predicts a trade-off between the competitive ability and grazing susceptibility of primary producers, driven by changes in their nutrient uptake rates. High nutrient uptake rates enhance the competitiveness of primary producers but also increase their nutritional quality for herbivores. This trade-off enables coexistence of nutrient exploiters and grazing avoiders. If herbivores are not selective, evolution favors runaway selection toward high nutrient uptake rates of the primary producers. However, if herbi-vores select nutritious food, the model predicts an evolutionarily stable strategy with lower nutrient uptake rates. When the model is parameterized for phytoplankton and zooplankton, the evolutionary dynamics result in plant-herbivore oscillations at ecological timescales , especially in environments with high nutrient availability and low selectivity of the herbivores. High herbivore selectivity stabilizes the community dynamics. These model predictions show that evolution permits nonequilibrium dynamics in plant-herbivore communities and shed new light on the evolutionary forces that shape the ecological stoichiometry of primary producers.},

Maiden flights and daily commutes of adult Odonata (damselflies, dragonflies) occur between wetland breeding area and adjacent upland habitat used for foraging, maturation, and nocturnal roosting. We measured abundance of dragonflies adjacent to a wetland in Mississippi, USA to determine if abundance varied with distance from water. Sexually mature males and combined females/prereproductive adult males (females-immatures) were recorded 10\textendash 160 m from the littoral edge of a 185 ha shallow reservoir. The number of dragonflies was dominated by Celithemis eponina throughout the study period. Mean abundance did not change with distance from water out to 160 m, both for all species combined and for each of three dominant species. In the assemblage, mature males outnumbered females-immatures in the 10\textendash 40 m distance, whereas the reverse occurred in the 130\textendash 160 m distance. At the species-level, there was a mixed response in the mature male: female-immature ratio, with little resemblance to the assemblage pattern. Results of this study suggest that wide buffer zones around wetlands may be essential to protect Odonata assemblages, especially females and sexually immature adults. Furthermore, odonate flight behavior may serve as a useful biocriterion to determine the width of ecologically significant wetland buffers.},

The conservation umbrella approach focuses management effort according to individual species that may confer protection to a larger community. This approach can help guide the management agenda towards attainable goals by maximizing conservation returns per unit effort. The development of the umbrella index has shown promise in identifying umbrella species in terrestrial ecosystems but has received little attention with respect to the management of wetland ecosystems. 2. We used the umbrella index to assess the umbrella potential of vascular plants and dragonflies (Odonata) from 15 wetland impoundments in northern Mississippi, USA. The presence of adult odonates was determined by repeated visual surveys and plant lists were compiled from 50 plots per site. 3. Umbrella schemes, or the sites occupied by top umbrella species, missed large numbers of beneficiary species and occurrences. With one exception, umbrella schemes failed to optimize conservation returns relative to randomized schemes in both assemblages. Also, umbrella schemes approximately equalled the performance of non-umbrella schemes both overall and for species with a low rate of occurrence. Low occurrence rates in both assemblages may have hindered umbrella index performance because the index assumes that species with moderate occurrence rates have the most umbrella potential. 4. Cross-taxon analyses (Mantel tests and McNemar tests) suggested transferability of plant and dragonfly umbrella schemes, and non-random association between the plants and dragonflies in these wetlands. 5. Synthesis and applications. Despite the questionable performance of umbrella schemes in our study, the use of a quantitative ecological tool such as the umbrella index instead of political or popularity criteria is strongly recommended for future selection of umbrella species. The results of cross-taxon analyses supported growing evidence for spatial and functional relationships between wetland macrophytes and adult odonates. We suggest that the more easily measured assemblage can be used to set priorities for wetland conservation planning in circumstances where human resources are constrained.},

However, the consequences of these preferences for distribution and abundance, and the underlying basis of habitat preferences are often unknown. The present study, conducted at Great Keppel Island, Australia, examined how distribution and abundance of an obligate corallivorous filefish, Oxymonacanthus longirostris, relates to coral architecture and diversity. The main drivers of the distribution and abundance of O. longirostris among reefs were coral species richness and availability of branching coral. Feeding territories had a higher percentage of Acropora coral than surrounding habitat. In addition, feeding territories had a higher percentage of the structurally important branching coral, Acropora nobilis, and a primary prey species, Acropora millepora. A series of pair-wise choice experiments in which both structural complexity and coral tissue quality were independently manipulated showed that habitat choice was primarily based on structural complexity and shelter characteristics. In addition, the choice for the preferred coral (A. nobilis) was stronger in the presence of a piscivorous fish. These results indicate that species-diverse coral habitats, which provide sufficient structural complexity along with nutritionally important prey, are essential for population persistence of this small, corallivorous reef fish.},

Giving up densities, the density of resources within a patch at which an individual ceases foraging, provide considerably more information than simply the amount of resources harvested. The giving up density of a forager, which is behaving optimally, should correspond to a harvest rate that just balances the metabolic costs of foraging, the predation cost of foraging, and the missed opportunity cost of not engaging in alternative activities. In addition, changes in giving up densities in response to climatic factors, predation risk, and missed opportunities can be used to test the model and to examine the consistency of the foragers' behavior. The technique was applied to a community of four Arizonan granivorous rodents (Perognathus amplus, Dipodomys merriami, Ammospermophilus harrisii, and Spermophilus tere-ticaudus). Aluminum trays filled with 3 grams of millet seeds mixed into 3 liters of sifted soil provided resource patches. The seeds remaining following a night or day of foraging were used to determine the giving up density, and footprints in the sifted sand indicated the identity of the forager. Giving up densities consistently differed in response to forager species, microhabitat (bush versus open), date, and station. The data also provide useful information regarding the relative foraging efficiencies and microhabitat preferences of the coexisting rodent species.},

  abstract = {Mammalian predator-prey systems are behaviorally sophisticated games of stealth and fear. But, traditional mass-action models of predator prey dynamics treat individuals as behav-iorally unresponsive "molecules" in Brownian motion. Foraging theory should provide the conceptual framework to envision the interaction. But, current models of predator feeding behavior generally envision a clever predator consuming large numbers of sessile and behaviorally inert prey (e.g., kangaroo rats, Dipodomys, collecting seeds from food patches). Here, we extend foraging theory to consider a predator-prey game of stealth and fear and then embed this game into the modeling of predator-prey population dynamics. The melding of the prey and predator's optimal behaviors with their population and community level consequences constitutes the ecology of fear. The ecology of fear identifies the endpoints of a continuum of N-driven (population size) versus j.L-driven (fear) systems. In N-driven systems, the major direct dynamical feedback involves predators killing prey, whereas)..L-driven systems involve the indirect effects from changes in fear levels and prey catchability. In j.L-driven systems, prey respond to predators by becoming more vigilant or by moving away from suspected predators. In this way, a predator (e.g., mountain lion, Puma concolor) depletes a\{ood patch (e.g., local herd of mule deer, Odocoi/eus hemionus) by frightening prey rather than by actually killing prey. Behavior buffers the system: a reduction in predator numbers should rapidly engender less vigilant and more catchable prey. The ecology of fear explains why big fierce carnivores should be and can be rare. In carnivore systems, ignore the behavioral game at one's peril. There have been two complementary but somewhat divergent approaches to predator prey interactions. Each approach focus-es on different aspects of the interaction. The first (Taylor, 1984) focuses on predators killing prey; predators are lethal. The second (Lima and Dill, 1990) focuses on fierce predators scaring their prey; prey treat predation risk as an activity cost and respond accordingly. In fact, fierceness is not a property of the' predator but rather a property of the prey. If prey exhibit conspicuous fear responses to their predator, the predator is deemed fierce. The first approach has given rise to mod-Journal of Mammaiofl\}'. 80(2):385-399, 1999 385 els of predator-prey population dynamics (Hassell, 1978; Murdoch and Oaten, 1975; Rosenzweig and MacArthur, 1963). In such models, predators influence population size of the prey and may influence number and stability properties of equilibrium points. Rarely, however, do these models consider the prey's behavioral response to the pred-ator's presence. Ignorance of behavioral responses may result in large deviations between the model's predictions and empirical outcomes. These deviations may be particularly acute for large mammalian predator-prey systems where prey and predator respond to each other in behaviorally sophis},

  abstract = {Species richness, defined as the number of species per unit area, is the simplest measure of biodiversity. Small-scale species richness generally refers to species richness at the scale of a single community, habitat or microhabitat. Understanding the factors that affect and are affected by small-scale species richness is fundamental to understanding how ecological communities are assembled and function and how biodiversity is maintained. Several factors affect small-scale species richness, including geographic factors such as the regional species pool, dispersal distance and ease of dispersal, biological factors such as competition, facilitation, and predation as well as environmental factors such as resource availability, environmental heterogeneity and disturbance frequency and intensity. The importance of these factors varies with scale of observation. Further, small-scale richness can impact aspects of ecosystem function including productivity, stability, and invasibility. Key Concepts Small-scale species richness is the number of species per unit area at the scale of a single community, habitat or microhabitat. Species richness is similar to alpha ({$\alpha$}) diversity, or the number of species occurring at the local scale in a relatively homogeneous area. Many factors affect small-scale species richness, including geographic (e.g. species pool, dispersal), biotic (e.g. competition, predation, facilitation) and abiotic (e.g. resource availability, environmental heterogeneity, disturbance frequency and intensity). The species pool is the set of species adapted to a site that are regionally available to colonise that site, and, in conjunction with dispersal processes, define the universe from which the ecological community is assembled. Immigration is affected by the distance between suitable habitat sites and the ability of propagules to become established at the local site, and can significantly increase species richness. Competition tends to decrease small-scale richness, and its impact is shaped by resource availability, the specific resources being competed for and ecological disturbances that reduce competition. Interactions among predators and prey, or pathogens and parasites and their hosts, can maintain or alter small-scale diversity, the impact being largely dependent on the level of dominance of the species directly impacted. While there is some evidence of a positive relationship between small-scale richness and productivity, other factors such as the number and identity of functional groups may be the direct cause of the relationship. Small-scale richness has complex effects on the stability and invasibility of local sites.},

  abstract = {The fundamental niche of many species is shifting with climate change, especially in sub-arctic ecosystems with pronounced recent warming. Ongoing warming in sub-arctic regions should lessen environmental constraints on tree growth and reproduction, leading to increased success of trees colonising tundra. Nevertheless, variable responses of treeline ecotones have been documented in association with warming temperatures. One explanation for time lags between increasingly favourable environmental conditions and treeline ecotone movement is reproductive limitations caused by low seed availability. Our objective was to assess the reproductive constraints of the dominant tree species at the treeline ecotone in the circumpolar north. We sampled reproductive structures of trees (cones and catkins) and stand attributes across circumarctic treeline ecotones. We used generalized linear mixed models to estimate the sensitivity of seed production and the availability of viable seed to regional climate, stand structure, and species-specific characteristics. Both seed production and viability of available seed were strongly driven by specific, sequential seasonal climatic conditions, but in different ways. Seed production was greatest when growing seasons with more growing degree days coincided with years with high precipitation. Two consecutive years with more growing degree days and low precipitation resulted in low seed production. Seasonal climate effects on the viability of available seed depended on the physical characteristics of the reproductive structures. Large-coned and -seeded species take more time to develop mature embryos and were therefore more sensitive to increases in growing degree days in the year of flowering and embryo development. Our findings suggest that both moisture stress and abbreviated growing seasons can have a notable negative influence on the production and viability of available seed at treeline. Our synthesis revealed that constraints on predispersal reproduction within the treeline ecotone might create a considerable time lag for range expansion of tree populations into tundra ecosystems.},

Our goals were to provide a comprehensive look at patterns of species distribution and relative species richness across Massachusetts and compare surveys where effort was and was not controlled. Observers encountered a total of 146 species, 11 of which were very widespread, having been recorded at more than 40 of the 54 properties examined. Thirty-five species were relatively rare, occurring at only 1 or 2 sanctuaries. A few sanctuaries were particularly notable for supporting somewhat uncommon species. These sites were not located in any particular ecoregion, but reflected local conditions. In surveys where effort was not controlled, a regression analysis indicated that about two thirds of the variation in species richness among sanctuaries could be ex-plained by the amount of observer effort, the size of the sanctuary, and the extent of wetland habitat. Quantitative surveys that used transects or point counts to control for sampling effort resulted in observation of fewer species, including state-listed taxa, compared to the non-quantitative surveys. Despite producing fewer species, data from these quantitative surveys can be used to make statistical comparisons with data from future studies and detect changes over time in species richness, abundance, and frequency of occurrence.},

  abstract = {We use focal-species analysis to apply a graph-theoretic approach to landscape connectivity in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. In doing so we demonstrate the utility of a mathematical graph as an ecological construct with respect to habitat connectivity. Graph theory is a well established mainstay of information technology and is concerned with highly efficient network flow. It employs fast algorithms and compact data structures that are easily adapted to landscape-level focal species analysis. American mink (Mustela vison) and prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea) share the same habitat but have different dispersal capabilities, and therefore provide interesting comparisons on connections in the landscape. We built graphs using GIS coverages to define habitat patches and determined the functional distance between the patches with least-cost path modeling. Using graph operations concerned with edge and node removal we found that the landscape is fundamentally connected for mink and fundamentally unconnected for prothonotary warblers. The advantage of a graph-theoretic approach over other modeling techniques is that it is a heuristic framework which can be applied with very little data and improved from the initial results. We demonstrate the use of graph theory in a metapopulation context, and suggest that graph theory as applied to conservation biology can provide leverage on applications concerned with landscape connectivity.},

  abstract = {1. Reliable assessment of animal populations is a long-standing challenge in wildlife ecology. Technological advances have led to widespread adoption of camera traps (CTs) to survey wildlife distribution, abundance and behaviour. As for any wildlife survey method, camera trapping must contend with sources of sampling error such as imperfect detection. Early applications focused on density estimation of naturally marked species, but there is growing interest in broad-scale CT surveys of unmarked populations and communities. Nevertheless, inferences based on detection indices are controversial, and the suitability of alternatives such as occupancy estimation is debatable. 2. We reviewed 266 CT studies published between 2008 and 2013. We recorded study objec- tives and methodologies, evaluating the consistency of CT protocols and sampling designs, the extent to which CT surveys considered sampling error, and the linkages between analyti- cal assumptions and species ecology. 3. Nearly two-thirds of studies surveyed more than one species, and a majority used response variables that ignored imperfect detection (e.g. presence\textendash absence, relative abundance). Many studies used opportunistic sampling and did not explicitly report details of sampling design and camera deployment that could affect conclusions. 4. Most studies estimating density used capture\textendash recapture methods on marked species, with spatially explicit methods becoming more prominent. Few studies estimated density for unmarked species, focusing instead on occupancy modelling or measures of relative abun- dance. While occupancy studies estimated detectability, most did not explicitly define key components of the modelling framework (e.g. a site) or discuss potential violations of model assumptions (e.g. site closure). Studies using relative abundance relied on assumptions of equal detectability, and most did not explicitly define expected relationships between mea- sured responses and underlying ecological processes (e.g. animal abundance and movement). 5. Synthesis and applications. The rapid adoption of camera traps represents an exciting tran- sition in wildlife survey methodology. We remain optimistic about the technology's promise, but call for more explicit consideration of underlying processes of animal abundance, move- ment and detection by cameras, including more thorough reporting of methodological details and assumptions. Such transparency will facilitate efforts to evaluate and improve the reliabil- ity of camera trap surveys, ultimately leading to stronger inferences and helping to meet mod- ern needs for effective ecological inquiry and biodiversity monitoring.},

  abstract = {Human development of pond and lake shorelines may significantly impact native lacustrine biota including a variety of aquatic macroinvertebrate groups. In an effort to better understand the habitat associations and sensitivities of lacustrine damselflies (Odonata: Zygoptera), we sampled adults in littoral macrophyte habitat during two flight periods at 35 randomly selected pond and lake sites in southern Maine during 2000 and 2001. Data were also col-lected to help characterize water body, shoreline disturbance, and aquatic vegetation at each study site. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling was used for ordination of damselfly assemblages, and coordinates from the most stable solution were related to site variables using forward stepwise multiple regression. Our results suggest that the diversity and composition of damselfly assemblages is related to the abundance and richness of littoral zone macrophytes, extent of riparian disturbance, benthic substrate granularity, and lake productivity; all variables subject to anthropogenic degradation on excessively developed waterbodies. Additionally, we developed a Habitat Tolerance Index useful for distinguishing between relative habitat specialists and generalists from among a diverse assemblage of 19 lacustrine species. Finally, species-specific damselfly associations with multiple genera of floating and emergent macro-phytes were assessed using both nonparametric cor-relation and multiplicative regression yielding significant relationships for 17 species, including two damselflies of global conservation concern (Enal-lagma laterale and E. pictum). We conclude that the protection of littoral and shoreline habitat integrity, with special emphasis on emergent and floating macrophytes, is critical to the conservation of lacus-trine biodiversity.},

  abstract = {To address the ongoing global biodiversity crisis, conservation approaches must be underpinned by robust in\- formation. Canada is uniquely positioned to contribute to meeting global biodiversity targets, with some of the world's largest remaining intact ecosystems, and a commitment to co-application of Indigenous ways of knowing alongside scientific, socioeconomic, and other approaches. We elicited input from experts across a range of disciplines to identify the key information needed to advance policy and management actions to conserve biodiversity in Canada. Experts concluded that, in many cases, a lack of information is not the major barrier to biodiversity conservation; instead, mechanisms to translate information into action are most urgently needed. Recognizing multiple ways of knowing, especially Indigenous knowledge systems, will be critical to support the transformative change needed to conserve biodiversity at a national scale. Collaboration among natural, social and data scientists can facilitate social change and biodiversity information management. Experts identified 50 priority information needs which emphasize the importance of (i) reviewing policies and actions and dissemi\- nating lessons learned from successes and failures; (ii) better understanding mechanisms to build public support; (iii) improving, in specific instances, understanding of the status and trends of habitats, species, ecosystems, and threats for planning and management; and (iv) mobilizing biodiversity information. Through the Convention on Biological Diversity, the global community has resolved to ``live in harmony with nature''; through our Canadian case-study, we conclude that the most pressing need to address this resolution is an improved understanding of how to move from conservation knowledge to conservation action.},

  abstract = {In view of the bewildering diversity of landscapes and possible patterns therein, our objectives were to see if a useful modeling method for directly comparing land mosaics could be developed based on graph theory, and whether basic spatial patterns could be identified that are common to diverse landscapes. The models developed were based on the spatial configuration of and interactions between landscape elements (ecosystems, land uses or ecotopes). Nodes represented landscape elements and linkages represented common boundaries between elements. Corridors, corridor intersections, and the matrix were successfully incorporated in the models. Twenty-five landscape graphs were constructed from aerial photographs chosen solely to represent a breadth of climates, land uses and human population densities. Seven distinctive clusters of nodes and linkages were identified and common, three of which, in the forms of a 'spider', 'necklace' and 'graph cell,' were in {$>$} 90\textasciitilde{} of the graphs. These represented respectively the following 'configurations' of patches, corridors and matrix: (1) a matrix area surrounding or adjoining many patches; (2) a corridor bisecting a heterogeneous area; and (3) a unit in a network of intersecting corridors. The models also indicated that the con-nectivity or number of linkages for several common elements, such as fields and house clearings, was relatively constant across diverse landscapes, and that linear shaped elements such as roads and rivers were the most connected. Several additional uses of this graph modeling, including compatibility with systems dynamics models, are pinpointed. Thus the method is useful in allowing simple direct comparisons of any scale and any landscape to help identify patterns and principles. A focus on the common and uncommon configurations should enhance our understanding of fluxes across landscapes, and consequently the quality of land planning and management.},

  abstract = {Agriculture and urban activities are major sources of phosphorus and nitro- gen to aquatic ecosystems. Atmospheric deposition further contributes as a source of N. These nonpoint inputs of nutrients are difficult to measure and regulate because they derive from activities dispersed over wide areas of land and are variable in time due to effects of weather. In aquatic ecosystems, these nutrients cause diverse problems such as toxic algal blooms, loss of oxygen, fish kills, loss of biodiversity (including species important for commerce and recreation), loss of aquatic plant beds and coral reefs, and other problems. Nutrient enrichment seriously degrades aquatic ecosystems and impairs the use of water for drinking, industry, agriculture, recreation, and other purposes. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain that (1) eutrophication is a widespread problem in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal oceans, caused by over- enrichment with P and N; (2) nonpoint pollution, a major source of P and N to surface waters of the United States, results primarily from agriculture and urban activity, including industry; (3) inputs of P and N to agriculture in the form of fertilizers exceed outputs in produce in the United States and many other nations; (4) nutrient flows to aquatic ecosystems are directly related to animal stocking densities, and under high livestock densities, manure production exceeds the needs of crops to which the manure is applied; (5) excess fertilization and manure production cause a P surplus to accumulate in soil, some of which is transported to aquatic ecosystems; and (6) excess fertilization and manure production on agricultural lands create surplus N, which is mobile in many soils and often leaches to downstream aquatic ecosystems, and which can also volatilize to the atmosphere, redepositing elsewhere and eventually reaching aquatic ecosystems. If current practices continue, nonpoint pollution of surface waters is virtually certain to increase in the future. Such an outcome is not inevitable, however, because a number of technologies, land use practices, and conservation measures are capable of decreasing the flow of nonpoint P and N into surface waters. From our review of the available scientific information, we are confident that: (1) nonpoint pollution of surface waters with P and N could be reduced by reducing surplus nutrient flows in agricultural systems and processes, reducing agricultural and urban runoff by diverse methods, and reducing N emissions from fossil fuel burning; and (2) eutrophi- cation can be reversed by decreasing input rates of P and N to aquatic ecosystems, but rates of recovery are highly variable among water bodies. Often, the eutrophic state is persistent, and recovery is slow},

Mammalian carnivores are good candidates for focal species because their distributional patterns often strongly reflect regional-scale population processes. We incorporated focal species analysis of four carnivore species, fisher (Martes pennanti), lynx (Lynx canadensis), wolverine (Gulo gulo), and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), into a regional conservation plan for the Rocky Mountains of the United States and Canada. We developed empirical habitat models for fisher, lynx, and wolverine based on a geographically extensive data set of trapping and sighting records. Predictor variables derived directly from satellite imagery were significantly correlated with carnivore distribution and allowed us to predict distribution in areas lacking detailed vegetation data. Although we lacked similar distributional data for grizzly bear, we predicted bear habitat by adapting and extrapolating previously published, regional-scale habitat models. Predicted habitat for grizzly bear has high overlap with that for wolverine, intermediate overlap with fisher, and low overlap with lynx. High-quality habitats for fisher and lynx, unlike those for wolverine and grizzly bear, are not strongly associated with low levels of human population and roads. Nevertheless, they are naturally fragmented by topography and vegetation gradients and are poorly represented in existing protected areas. Areas with high biological productivity and low human impact are valuable habitat for all four species but are limited in extent. Predicted habitat values for lynx and wolverine are significantly correlated with trapping data from an area outside the extent of the original data set. This supports the use of empirical distribution models as the initial stage in a regional-scale monitoring program. Our results suggest that a comprehensive conservation strategy for carnivores in the region must consider the needs of several species, rather than a single, presumed umbrella species. Coordinated planning across multiple ownerships is necessary to prevent further fragmentation of carnivore habitat, especially in the U.S.-Canada border region.},

Factors such as competition, habitat availability, and male characteristics can influence an individu-al's ability to establish and maintain a territory. The risk of predation can have an important influence on feeding and reproduction; however, few have studied its effect on territoriality. We investigated territoriality in a haremic, polygynous species of coral reef herbivore, Spari-soma aurofrenatum (redband parrotfish), across eight reefs in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary that were either protected or unprotected from fishing of piscivorous fishes. We examined how territory size and quality varied with reef protection status, competition, predation risk, and male size. We then determined how territory size and quality influenced harem size and female size to understand the effect of territoriality on reproductive potential. We found that protected reefs trended towards having more large predatory fishes and that territories there were smaller but had greater algal nutritional quality relative to unprotected reefs. Our data suggest that even though males in protected sites have smaller territories, which support fewer females, they may improve their reproductive potential by choosing nutritionally rich areas, which support larger females. Thus, reef protection appears to shape the trade-off that herbivorous fishes make between territory size and quality. Furthermore, we provide evidence that males in unprotected sites, which are generally less complex than protected sites, choose territories with higher structural complexity, suggesting the importance of this type of habitat for feeding and reproduction in S. aurofrenatum. Our work argues that the loss of corals and the resulting decline in structural complexity, as well as management efforts to protect reefs, could alter the territory dynamics and reproductive potential of important herbivorous fish species.},

  abstract = {Soil respiration is frequently measured as a surrogate for biological activities and is important in soil carbon cycling. The heterotrophic component of soil respiration is primarily driven by microbial decomposition of leaf litter and soil organic matter, and is partially controlled by resource availability. In North American temperate deciduous forests, invasive European and Asian earthworms are known to variously affect soil properties and resource availability through their feeding, burrowing, and casting behaviors, and may affect different components of soil respiration through modulating the microbial communities. By tracing litter-derived C from 13 C and 15 N double-enriched leaf litter into soil and CO 2 efflux in a mesocosm experiment, we tested the hypothesis that earthworms inhibit litter C-derived soil respiration by reducing resource availability and microbial biomass, and further examined how species-specific effects of earthworms on soil respiration are mediated by soil microbial community. We showed that while earthworms generally had no effect on total soil respiration, the interaction between Octo-lasion lacteum and Lumbricus rubellus had a significant negative non-additive effect, presumably through affecting anaerobic microsites in the soil. Moreover, litter C-derived soil respiration was reduced by the Asian Amynthas hilgendorfi, the European L. rubellus, and the North American native species Eisenoides lonnbergi, but not by the European species O. lacteum. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and structural equation modeling indicated that while soil bacteria and fungi abundances were affected by earthworm species identities, the observed reduction of litter C-derived soil respiration could not be fully explained by changes in microbial biomass. We attributed these effects to earthworm-induced aggregate formation, reduction of microbial transformation of labile carbon, and antimicrobial peptide activities, and concluded that the mechanisms through which the four earthworm species affect the fate of litter-derived C and its mineralization are species-specific.},

Exposure to the natural environment, especially blue space, has been consistently linked to better mental health. While previous studies have disentangled the positive relationship between neighborhood blue space and mental health, scant attention has been paid to pathways through which neighborhood blue space affects mental health among Chinese urban elderly individuals. Based on questionnaire data collected from Guangzhou in 2018, remote sensing images, street-scapes, and other such sources, we extracted various blue space indicators. We employed multilevel linear regression modeling, mediating effect modeling to examine bio-psychosocial path\- ways and mechanisms linking exposure to blue space and elderly individuals' mental health. Propensity score matching method was employed to deal with selection bias. According to this empirical analysis, firstly, neighborhood exposure to blue space was significantly associated with elderly individuals' mental health. Sec\- ondly, environmental harm reduction, stress reduction, and social contact facilitation played a separate role in mediating the effect of blue space exposure on elderly individuals' mental health. These findings confirm the mediation pathways in the context of Chinese cities. Our research enriches the empirical research on blue space and public health from the perspective of health geography, and suggests the need for ``healthy neighborhood'' and ``health aging'' planning in Chinese settings.},

A monitoring programme has been established focusing on the investigation of the functional integrity of these inshore structures: first results show that the sites isolated from the Danube serve as stepping stone biotopes for dragonflies and amphibians. Particularly amphibians are suitable indicators of the ecological functioning of riparian migration linkages on a (macro-) habitat scale.

Over the course of just a few years, deep learning has revolutionized several research fields such as bioinformatics and medicine with its flexibility and ability to process large and complex datasets. As ecological datasets are becoming larger and more complex, we believe these methods can be useful to ecologists as well. In this paper, we review existing implementations and show that deep learning has been used successfully to identify species, classify animal behaviour and estimate biodiversity in large datasets like camera-trap images, audio recordings and videos. We demonstrate that deep learning can be beneficial to most ecological disciplines, including applied contexts, such as management and conservation. We also identify common questions about how and when to use deep learning, such as what are the steps required to create a deep learning network, which tools are available to help, and what are the requirements in terms of data and computer power. We provide guidelines, recommendations and useful resources, including a reference flowchart to help ecologists get started with deep learning. We argue that at a time when automatic monitoring of populations and ecosystems generates a vast amount of data that cannot be effectively processed by humans anymore, deep learning could become a powerful reference tool for ecologists.},

We collected data from 30 radiocollared bears on a rolling plateau where a large portion of the landscape had been modified by human activities, primarily forestry. We also monitored 24 radiocollared bears in mountain areas largely inaccessible to humans. Bears that lived on the plateau existed at less than one-quarter the density of bears in the mountains. Plateau bears ate more high-quality food items, such as meat and berries, leading us to conclude that food limitation was not responsible for the differences in densities. We hypothesized that plateau bears were limited by human-caused mortality associated with roads constructed for forestry activities. Independent estimates of bear population size from DNA-based mark\textendash recapture techniques allowed us to link populations to habitats using RSF models to scale habitat use patterns to population density. To evaluate whether differences in land-cover type, roads, or mortality risk could account for the disparity in density we used the mountain RSF model to predict habitat use and number of bears on the plateau and vice versa. We predicted increases ranging from 34 bears to 96 bears on the plateau when switching model coefficients, excluding land-cover types; when exchanging land-cover coefficients, the model predicted that the plateau population would be 9 bears lower than was observed. Large reductions in the numbers of mountain bears were predicted by habitat-selection models of bears using the plateau landscape. Although RSF models estimated in mountain and plateau landscapes could not predict bear use and abundance in the other areas, contrasts in models between areas provided a useful tool for examining the effects of human activities on grizzly bears.},

The land cover map is based upon 2011 spring colour aerial photography at a resolution of 20 cm, supplemented by other data sources. These sources are:Non-evaluated Wetland Mapping 2011, City of Ottawa, 2016.Evaluated Wetlands, extracted from Wetlands, Land Information Ontario, Province of OntarioAggregate Licenses, City of OttawaTransportation, City of Ottawa2010 Land Use, City of Ottawa (Wooded Areas, Agricultural Land Use)Land Cover 2011 should not be used in place of these data sources for regulatory purposes.The main improvement of this mapping over past land use mapping is the incorportation of accurate non-evaluated wetland mapping, prepared by the City of Ottawa. Non-evaluated wetlands were identified and delineated using "heads up" digitization at a scale of 1:2000 or greater. Wetlands were delineated from City of Ottawa Spring 2011 colour aerial photography with a resolution of 20 cm. During the digitization process, additional data layers were used to provide topographic and historical context: City of Ottawa LiDAR data (as 1 m, 50 cm, and 25 cm contours, plus hillshading), and aerial photography from 2014, 2008, 2005, 2002, 1999, 1991, and 1976.Amalgamation and editing of the contributing data layers was accompanied by substantial geoprocessing, especially to ensure the removal of polygon slivers and gaps. This processing involved generalization procedures which resulted in many cases in minor changes or simplification of polygons from the original data layers. Although boundary changes should be limited to approximately 5 meters, users should make reference to the original data sources where exact boundaries are required. This is especially true for evaluated wetland boundaries.Land Cover 2011 is intended to be consistent with the Provincial Ecological Land Classification System. It consists of the following land cover classes (Class Code):2 - Sand and Gravel3 - Settlement4 - Transportation5 - Water7 - Wetland8 - Wooded Area9 - Crop and Pasture10 - Grassland11 - Rock BarrenThe original land cover map identified "unevaluated wetlands" and "evaluated wetlands" separately, as classes 6 and 7. They have been amalgamated into class 7, "Wetland".Two additional attributes are currently included:Treed (0 - not treed, 1 - treed) (Class Codes 6, 7, 8)Sub Class (0 - not hedgerow, 1 - hedgerow) (Class Code 8)Additional sub-classes will be added in the future, including forest type, wetland type, settlement type, impervious/pervious, and water type.Land Cover 2011 includes polygons that are much smaller than the 0.5 ha recommended in the Ecological Land Classification System, or the 0.2 ha recommended in the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System. This results primarily from use of the City of Ottawa 2010 Wooded Area data (from the 2010 Land Use Survey) to identify wooded wetlands (Class Codes 6 and 7, Treed). The cumulative contribution of these smaller polygons to overall forest cover was considered sufficiently substantial to merit retention.Classification errors are most likely to occur between grassland and woodland, and grassland and crop/pasture. Future refinement of the map may include splitting of the grassland category to include savannah and thicket land cover types. Small errors in mapping are also certain to have resulted through geoprocessing and from the supplementary data sources. This will be corrected as they are discovered.Land Cover 2011 will provide the base for 2014 and 2017 landcover mapping.}

The first global assessment of an insect order (Odonata) provides new context to the ongoing discussion of current biodiversity loss. A randomly selected sample of 1500 (26.4\%) of the 5680 described dragonflies and damselflies was assessed using IUCN's Red List criteria. Distribution maps for each species were created and species were assigned to habitat types. These data were analysed in respect to threat level for regions and habitat types. We have found that one in 10 species of dragon-flies and damselflies is threatened with extinction. This threat level is among the lowest of groups that have been assessed to date, suggesting that previous estimates of extinction risk for insects might be mis-leading. However, Odonata only comprise a small invertebrate order, with above-average dispersal ability and relatively wide distribution ranges. For conservation science and policy to be truly representative of global biodiversity a representative cross-section of invertebrates needs to be included.},

  abstract = {The idea that simplicity of explanation is important in science is as old as science itself. However, scientists often assume that parsimonious theories, hypothesis and models are more plausible than complex ones, forgetting that there is no empirical evidence to connect parsimony with credibility. The justification for the parsimony principle is strongly dependent on philosophical and statistical inference. Parsimony may have a true epistemic value in the evaluation of correlative and predictive models, as simpler models are less prone to overfitting. However, when natural mechanisms are explicitly modelled to represent the causes of biological phenomena, the application of the parsimony principle to judge the plausibility of mechanistic models would entail an unsupported belief that nature is simple. Here, we discuss the challenges we face in justifying, measuring, and assessing the trade-off between simplicity and complexity in ecological and evolutionary studies. We conclude that invoking the parsimony principle in ecology and evolution is particularly important in model- building programs in which models are viewed primarily as an operational tool to make predictions (an instrumentalist view) and in which data play a prominent role in deciding the structure of the model. However, theoretical advances in ecology and evolutionary biology may be derailed by the use of the parsimony principle to judge explanatory mechanistic models that are designed to understand complex natural phenomena. We advocate a parsimonious use of the parsimony principle.},

The nitrogen retention efficiency was close to 100\% of the input, except for dissolved organic nitrogen at the end of the growing season. The denitrification rates measured by the acetylene reduction in the sediment ranged between 0 and 3.46 mg N m-2 d-1 and represented between 0 and 12\% of the inflowing dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Emergent macrophytes accumulated between 20 and 100 mg N m-2 d-1, which accounts for between 66 and 100\% of the inflowing dissolved inorganic nitrogen. The wetland sediment accumulated between III and 250 mg N m-2 d-1 during the six month growing season. The removal rate constants calculated according to a first - order plug - flow kinetics, were between 0.01-0.075 m d-1 for total nitrogen and 0.01\textendash 0.3 m d-1 for dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Plant uptake, detritus accumulation and decomposition, and nitrogen recycling in the sediment are major processes for nitrogen retention and recycling in the wetlands. This type of wetlands, restored from ricefields, act as highly efficient water polishing filters for agricultural runoff and, at the same time, can contribute to increase the habitat biodiversity of large areas where rice is cultivated extensively.},

While dispersal behaviour of many orders of winged insects has received a great deal of attention, the dispersal characteristics of odonates have been poorly documented. We used capture-mark-recapture techniques to study dispersal behaviour of seven species of odonates breeding on a network of 11 small ponds in Cheshire, U.K. The ponds ranged in size from 615 to 1300 m2 and varied from 30 to 860 m apart. We found surprisingly high rates of dispersal between ponds, with 10-47\% per species of recaptured individuals moving from their natal pond. The mean probability of dispersal differed significantly among species but the relationship between the probability of dispersal and distance moved consistently followed a simple negative exponential curve for all species. Most individuals stayed at their natal pond, but a few moved long distances. Neither the age at which an individual was marked (teneral vs sexually mature) nor its sex significantly affected its tendency to disperse. The negative exponential relationship suggests that dispersal should be relatively easy to incorporate in more complex models of odonate spatio-temporal dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, multi-species study to assess dispersal behaviour of odonates by direct observation},

  abstract = {Reduction of terrestrial vegetation and degradation of water quality are among the factors driving insect population decline in growing cities. In this study, we investigated the extent of habitat deterioration, behavioral and physiological responses, and fitness of a damselfly [Hetaerina americana (F.)] population in a semitropical region in central Mexico. The study population was located in a riverine area that crosses a small urban area (Tehuixtla city). We related two habitat variables (tree/shrub covered area and numbers of wastewater outlets) to presumable damselfly responses (larval and adult abundance, duration of adults exposed directly to sunlight, lipid content and muscle mass, and egg survival) over the years 2002 and 2016. We detected a reduction in terrestrial vegetation cover, an increase in wastewater outlets, and a decrease in larval and adult abundance. Adults were more exposed to sunlight in 2016 than in 2002 and showed a reduced lipid content and muscle mass in 2016. Egg survival also decreased. Although correlative, these results suggest impairment of damselfly condition (via lipid and muscle reduction) and fitness as urbanization increases.},

  abstract = {Transpiration is generally considered a wasteful but unavoidable consequence of photosynthesis, occurring because water is lost when stomata open for CO 2 uptake. Additionally, transpiration has been ascribed the functions of cooling leaves, driving root to shoot xylem transport and mass Xow of nutrients through the soil to the rhizosphere. As a consequence of the link between nutrient mass Xow and transpiration, nutrient availability, particularly that of NO 3 \textexclamdown{} , partially regulates plant water Xux. Nutrient regulation of transpiration may function through the concerted regulation of: (1) root hydraulic conductance through control of aquaporins by NO 3 \textexclamdown{} , (2) shoot stomatal conductance (g s) through NO production, and (3) pH and phytohormone regulation of g s. These mechanisms result in biphasic responses of water Xux to NO 3 \textexclamdown{} availability. The consequent trade-oV between water and nutrient Xux has important implications for understanding plant distributions, for production of water use-eYcient crops and for understanding the consequences of global-change-linked CO 2 suppression of transpiration for plant nutrient acquisition.},

Recent Findings Recent studies in landscape ecology have employed advances made in remote sensing. These include the use of reliable and open datasets derived from remote sensing, the availability of new sources for freely available satellite imagery, and machine-learning image classification techniques for classifying land cover types. Remote sensing data sources and methods have been used in landscape ecology to examine landscape structure. Additionally, these data sources and methods have been used to analyze landscape function including the effects of landscape structure and landscape change on biodiversity and population dynamics. Lastly, remote sensing data sources and methods have been used to analyze historical landscape changes and to simulate future landscape changes.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY Purpose To determine the frequency of use of the three main classes of over-the-counter analgesics: acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and aspirin in two large US female cohorts. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of the frequency of analgesic use and the characteristics of users in female participants in the Nurses Health Study I (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 86 985) and the Nurses Health Study II (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 93 002) who were between the ages of 33 and 77 years. Information on frequency of current analgesic use was assessed by mailed questionnaire. Results All three classes of analgesics were used frequently. For example, acetaminophen was used !1 day/week by more than 20\% of women. NSAIDs were used !1 day/week by 42\% of women aged 51 years or younger, and aspirin was used !6 days/week by 25\% women over age 51 years. The frequency of use of the individual analgesics varied by age (p {$<$} 0.001). In addition, women in the highest category of use of any of the analgesics tended to have a higher body mass index, were more likely to have hypertension and diabetes, and were more likely to be current smokers. Conclusions Analgesic use is very common among US women. Physicians should be cognizant of the frequency of use of the various over-the-counter analgesics in their female patient population.},

Dissolved organic carbon, TP, Chl a, Ca, and Mg are negatively related to catchment slope, whereas NO3 - and NH4 + increase with increasing slope. Concentrations of more conservative constituents (SO4 2-, Na, K) increase with decreasing elevation as a result of higher evapotranspiration and lower precipitation at low elevations. Catchment variables (slope, drainage area, percent wetlands) are as good predictors of Chl a (r2 = 0.7) as are water chemistry variables (TP, Ca, Mg, and pH). Dominant vegetation (deciduous vs. coniferous) has little or no influence on lake water chemistry. Hydrogeological data for the Canadian Shield suggest that, during periods of high runoff, the development of waterlogged areas and the importance of overland flow on saturated soils are inversely proportional to catchment slope. We propose that the strong influence of catchment slope on water quality is due to slope-dependent seasonal waterlogging, which determines the fate (retention or export to surface waters) of dissolved substances produced within and moving through the forest floor.},

This multi-scale nature of habitat suitability complicates the translation of inferences to single, spatial depictions of habitat required for conservation of species. We estimated resource selection functions (RSFs) across three scales for a threatened ungulate, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), with two objectives: (1) to infer the relative effects of two forms of anthropogenic disturbance (forestry and linear features) on woodland caribou distributions at multiple scales and (2) to estimate scale-integrated resource selection functions (SRSFs) that synthesize results across scales for management-oriented habitat suitability mapping. We found a previously undocumented scale-specific switch in woodland caribou response to two forms of anthropogenic disturbance. Caribou avoided forestry cut-blocks at broad scales according to first-and second-order RSFs and avoided linear features at fine scales according to third-order RSFs, corroborating predictions developed according to predator-mediated effects of each disturbance type. Additionally, a single SRSF validated as well as each of three single-scale RSFs when estimating habitat suitability across three different spatial scales of prediction. We demonstrate that a single SRSF can be applied to predict relative habitat suitability at both local and landscape scales in support of critical habitat identification and species recovery.},

Although many available spatial models and metrics (e.g., distance to or density of disturbance) characterize impact patterns of anthropogenic disturbance on the landscape, a general evaluation of model performance against empirical measurements of ecological integrity is lacking. We tested both distancebased and disturbance-density models in relation to ecological indicators. The models included roads, residential and commercial development, agricultural land use, mining, energy development infrastructure, and transmission structures as disturbance sources. Model parameters were based on expert input and results from the published literature. The disturbance models were tested against two disparate and independent measures of habitat quality: A floristic quality index and measures of greater sagegrouse population integrity. Floristic quality scores were significantly lower in vegetation plots closer to disturbances in a general distance-based disturbance model across Colorado. Although the proportion of variation in floristic quality explained by anthropogenic disturbance was relatively low (8.5-11.8\%), it appeared to represent a ubiquitous baseline negative effect of proximity to anthropogenic disturbance on the quality of vegetation communities. For both distance- And density-based greater sage-grouse models, modeled disturbance indices were significantly lower (10-12 times) near active than historic leks, and numbers of males counted at leks increased significantly (3.2-3.4 times) as modeled disturbance decreased. Our findings indicate that as a general class, geospatial models can depict effects of anthropogenic disturbance on both plant communities and individual animal species. Empirical validation of disturbance models focused on other species or regions is recommended to further evaluate the utility and reliability of these methods.},

Leaf physiological parameters were mainly influenced by the light gradient, whereas crown morphological and whole-tree allocational parameters were mainly influenced by tree size. No single physiological, morphological or allocational trait was identified that could explain the difference in shade tolerance between the species. Yellow birch had higher growth rates, biomass allocation to branches and leaf physiological plasticity and lower crown morphological plasticity in unmodified understory light than sugar maple. Sugar maple did not display significant physiological plasticity, but showed variation with tree size in both crown morphology and whole-tree biomass allocation. When sugar maple was small, a greater proportion of whole-tree biomass was allocated to roots. However, physiological differences between the species decreased with decreasing light and most morphological and allocational differences tended to disappear with increasing tree size, suggesting that many species differences in shade-tolerance are expressed mainly during the seedling stage. Understory trees of both species survived for 4 years under shade nets, possibly because of higher plasticity when small and the use of stored reserves when taller.},

However, when used in circum-neutral water treatments, cement-bound Bauxsol pellets produce a sustained pH and alkalinity spike due to the presence of unreacted CaO in the cement binder. This study developed a pellet treatment system to minimize the alkalinity/pH spike. The recipe for pelletization consisted of Bauxsol powder, ordinary Portland cement (OPC), hydrophilic fumed silica, aluminum powder, a viscosity modifier, and water. Several batches (including different ratios and sizes) were run using modified makeup waters (H 2 O + CO 2 or NaHCO 3) or curing brines (CO 2 , NaHCO 3 , or Mg/ CaCl 2). Alkalinity, pH stability, and slake durability tests were performed on pellets before and/or after curing. The best result for reducing the alkalinity/pH spike was obtained from a MgCl 2 , CaCl 2 bath treatment using a Bauxsol:cement ratio of 2.8:1 (pH 8.28; alkalinity 75.1 mg/L) for a 100 g batch or 2.45:1 (pH 8.05; alkalinity 35.4 mg/L) for a 1 kg batch. Although brine curing does provide a control on pH/alkalinity release, the pellets may still contain unreacted CaO. Therefore, a freshwater rinse of pellets before treating circum-neutral waters is recommended as is the continued investigation of alternative pellet binders.},

Specifically, species richness is predicted to peak at mid-altitude on arid-zone mountains with opposite temperature and precipitation gradients, and phenological windows of activity are expected to be more synchronized, shorter, and later with altitude.  A transect on the Pacific slope of the Andes in northern Chile (23\textdegree S, 2400\textendash 5000 m a.s.l.) was observed fortnightly between October 2008 and June 2009. The 13 species observed showed high altitudinal and temporal turnover, dividing the transect into three entomofaunal zones that follow well-documented altitudinal vegetation belts. Species richness peaked at mid-altitude in the Puna shrub belt, the zone with highest plant productivity and diversity, supporting McCain's water-temperature hypothesis. Community-level predictions about phenology were not met: instead, the flight period began earlier at high altitude, presumably due to earlier water availability, and neither synchronization nor duration of flight periods varied consistently with altitude. At the species level, relationships between butterfly phenology and altitude were variable, suggesting no direct effect of altitude but rather complex effects of changing environmental conditions that vary according to individual species' ecological requirements, host plant use, and lifecycle.},

Characteristics of human society\textemdash including culture, economics, technology and politics\textemdash underlie social patterns and activity, creating a heterogeneous environment that can influence and be influenced by both ecological and evolutionary processes. Increasing research on urban ecology and evolutionary biology has coincided with growing interest in eco-evolutionary dynamics, which encompasses the interactions and reciprocal feedbacks between evolution and ecology. Research on both urban evolutionary biology and eco-evolutionary dynamics frequently focuses on contemporary evolution of species that have potentially substantial ecological\textemdash and even social\textemdash significance. Still, little work fully integrates urban evolutionary biology and eco-evolutionary dynamics, and rarely do researchers in either of these fields fully consider the role of human social patterns and processes. Because cities are fundamentally regulated by human activities, are inherently interconnected and are frequently undergoing social and economic transformation, they represent an opportunity for ecologists and evolutionary biologists to study urban ``socio-eco-evolutionary dynamics.'' Through this new framework, we encourage researchers of urban ecology and evolution to fully integrate human social drivers and feedbacks to increase understanding and conservation of ecosystems, their functions and their contributions to people within and outside cities.},

  abstract = {Seed coat colour in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is determined by activity of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway resulting in the presence or absence of specific anthocyanins, tannins and glycosidic flavanols. These secondary metabolites have anti-oxidant properties in the case of anthocyanins and glycosidic flavonols and strongly influence dietary mineral bioavailability in the case of tannins. The modification of tannin content is a goal of biofortification breeding programs, while almost all bean improvement considers seed colour in selection priorities as this affects consumer preference and food quality. In the present study, we analyzed condensed tannins, tannin monomers and anthocyanin levels in an inter-genepool population derived from the cross DOR364 ?? G19833 using HPLC and spectrophotometric methods. The overall average for condensed tannins expressed as percentage in seed coats was 20.04\%. The ranges were between 8.0\% and 27.9\% for soluble tannins (ST), 1.5\% and 5.4\% for insoluble tannins (IT), and 10.7\% and 30.9\% for total tannins (TT). Anthocyanins in seed coats averaged 0.08\% (0.013-0.21\% range) expressed as delphinidin-3-glucoside equivalents for the population with the distribution biased towards low content. All traits had large variability between genotypes and showed transgressive segregation, indicating quantitative inheritance for tannin content and oligogenic control of anthocyanins. Condensed tannins in the genotypes were mainly composed of catechin (60.3\%), gallocatechin (25\%), and afzelechin (14.7\%) as monomeric units. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Most studies addressing dragonfly ecology have focused on the importance of aquatic habitats, while the value of surrounding terrestrial habitats has often been overlooked. However, species associated with temporary aquatic habitats must persist in terrestrial environments for long periods. Little is known about the importance of terrestrial habitat patches for dragonflies, or about other factors that initiate or influence dispersal behaviour. The aim of this study was to reveal the relationship between population dynamics of the threatened dragonfly species Sympetrum depressiusculum at its natal site and its dispersal behaviour or routine movements within its terrestrial home range. We used a mark\textendash release\textendash recapture method (marking 2,881 adults) and exuviae collection with the Jolly\textendash Seber model and generalized linear models to analyse seasonal and spatial patterns of routine movement in a heterogeneous Central European landscape. Our results show that utilisation of terrestrial habitat patches by adult dragonflies is not random and may be relatively long term (approximately 3 mo). Adult dragonflies were present only in areas with dense vegetation that provided sufficient resources; the insects were absent from active agricultural patches (p = 0.019). These findings demonstrate that even a species tightly linked to its natal site utilises an area that is several orders of magnitude larger than the natal site. Therefore, negative trends in the occurrence of various dragonfly species may be associated not only with disturbances to their aquatic habitats, but also with changes in the surrounding terrestrial landscape.},

Some freshwater ecosystems that have been modified due to human activities can serve as important secondary habitats for odonate assemblages; however, the majority of studies addressing the value of secondary habitats in industrial and urban areas for adult dragonfly diversity have been limited to the local scale, and the value of such habitats for gamma diversity is still unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between human transformations of land use/land cover and dragonfly diversity. We interpolated the information based on dragonfly occurrence per grid cell and land cover data, indicating naturalness and degradation in 677 grid cells in the Czech Republic. Species richness did not correspond to habitat naturalness, but the occurrence of endangered species was significantly positively correlated with increasing naturalness; thus, habitat degradation and/or the level of naturalness significantly affected species composition, while species richness remained unchanged. Threatened species that occur predominantly in natural areas and threatened species with a dominant occurrence in degraded squares were also separated, which indicated that the conservation of the latter should be prioritised.},

  abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

  abstract = {This paper establishes the foundation of new systems' Consolidity Theory using the Arithmetic Fuzzy Logic-Based Representation approach for investigating the internal behavior of systems operating in fully fuzzy environment. Consolidated systems are defined as being stable at the original state, but due to fuzzy variations in their inputs or parameters tend to react accordingly in a manner leading to maintaining their consolidity and strength, or vice versa. Under the new theory, systems are classified into consolidated , neutrally consolidated or unconsolidated type based on their output fuzziness reaction to combined input and parameters fuzziness action. The systems' Consolidity Theory is demonstrated by several examples of mathematical functions of different dimensionalities, control theory and Predator-Prey populations' dynamics. The suggested Consolidity Theory is illustrated to be an effective tool for revealing the inner property of systems and predicting their hidden behavior when operating in fully fuzzy environment. Monitoring and control of systems' consolidity through forward and backward fuzz-iness tracking are suggested during systems' operation, for avoiding their drifting to possible unwanted unconsolidated domains. It is shown that the analysis will lead at the end to determining the system's consolidity index that could be regarded as a general basic internal property of the system. Such systems' consolidity concept can also be defined far from fuzzy logic, and is applicable to the analysis and design of various types of linear, nonlinear, multivariable, dynamic, etc., systems in real life in the fields of basic sciences, evolutionary systems, engineering, biology, medicine, economics, finance, political and management sciences, social sciences, humanities, and education.},

Yet, relating foraging processes and habitat selection patterns in resident populations, where spatial heterogeneity of food resources is fine-grained and/or where the portion of edible plants (i.e. the foodscape) is low, is challenging. We addressed this issue in a mountain population of chamois Rupicapra rupicapra, an intermediate feeder, whose individuals do not migrate. We relied on a rare combination of data on habitat use of 50 GPS-collared females and data on the quantity (biomass) and quality (phenology) of edible resources in their landscape, derived from field sampling of vegetation, remote sensing and diet (DNA barcoding). The foodscape of the chamois was composed of a low proportion of the available biomass ({$<$}18\%), including relatively high-quality plants, with low spatial covariation between plant phenology and biomass. Chamois avoided areas with a low edible biomass (where the intake rate may be too low) and focused on areas with plants at approximately the flowering stage, whatever the average plant phenological stage available. Due to this constant preference for flowering plants, home range selection ratios therefore shifted during the summer from a selection of more advanced plants in June to their avoidance in August. When the phenology scores of all plants available, rather than edible plants only, were considered, areas with relatively more advanced plants were selected all summer long. This exemplifies that, when traits from edible plants are different from those of all plants available, it is crucial to consider the actual foodscape to decipher forage and habitat selection processes. By integrating species-specific dimensions of resources in habitat selection studies, we believe understanding of the foraging processes will be improved.},

In this article, we analyze the effects of urban sprawl on the ecological patterns and processes in the Montreal Metropolitan Region (MMR) between 1966 and 2010. The dispersed sprawl of low-density urban areas within the territory during this period sharply increased the fragmentation of the territory, isolating the few remaining natural spaces and decreasing their ecological connectivity and, ultimately, biodiversity. The results obtained clearly show that land-use changes that occurred in the MMR have caused profound changes in landscape properties, both structurally and functionally, and especially from 1981 to 2010. In 1966, around 45\% of the land had a high or very high level of connectivity, and almost 38\% in 1981. By 2010 only 6.5\% of the landscape was connected and 73\% of the territory possessed no or low connectivity.},

We review recent developments integrating biological stoichiometry and metabolic scaling theories in the context of plant ecology and global change. Although vascular plants exhibit wide variation in foliar carbon: nitrogen: phosphorus ratios, they exhibit a higher degree of 'stoichiometric homeostasis' than previously appreciated. Thus, terrestrial carbon: nitrogen: phosphorus stoichiometry will reflect the effects of adjustment to local growth conditions as well as species' replacements. Plant stoichiometry exhibits size scaling, as foliar nutrient concentration decreases with increasing plant size, especially for phosphorus. Thus, small plants have lower nitrogen: phosphorus ratios. Furthermore, foliar nutrient concentration is reflected in other tissues (root, reproductive, support), permitting the development of empirical models of production that scale from tissue to whole-plant levels. Plant stoichiometry exhibits large-scale macroecological patterns, including stronger latitudinal trends and environmental correlations for phosphorus concentration (relative to nitrogen) and a positive correlation between nutrient concentrations and geographic range size. Given this emerging knowledge of how plant nutrients respond to environmental variables and are connected to size, the effects of global change factors (such as carbon dioxide, temperature, nitrogen deposition) can be better understood. \textcopyright{} The Authors (2010).

Ecological stoichiometry(1,2) provides an integrative approachfor such analyses, as all organisms are composed of the same major elements (C, N, P) whose balance affectsproduction, nutrient cycling, and food-web dynamics(3,4). Here we show both similarities and differences in the C:N:Pratios of primary producers (autotrophs) and invertebrate primary consumers (herbivores) across habitats. Terrestrialfood webs are built on an extremely nutrient-poor autotroph base with C:P and C:N ratios higher than in lakeparticulate matter, although the N:P ratios are nearly identical. Terrestrial herbivores (insects) and their freshwatercounterparts (zooplankton) are nutrient-rich and indistinguishable in C:N:P stoichiometry. In both lakes and terrestrialsystems, herbivores should have low growth efficiencies (10-30\%) when consuming autotrophs with typicalcarbon-to-nutrient ratios. These stoichiometric constraints on herbivore growth appear to be qualitatively similar andwidespread in both environments.},

As the first attempt at a synthesis, we analyzed all available data on amphibian mortality in Europe and combined them with four previously unpublished surveys conducted by us. Based on our recalculation of road-kill counts in terms of species-specific road-kill recordability, we conclude that, in lowland Central Europe, the common toads, Bufo bufo, are the most common victims of vehicular traffic in suburban landscapes, while the common frogs, Rana temporaria and Triturus newts, prevail in rural landscapes. The green frogs also tend to be more frequent in rural areas. Common tree frogs, Hyla arborea, are unexpectedly rare in the road-kill record despite their terrestrial and migratory habits. In consideration of problems with obtaining accurate amphib-ian population estimates, we further propose the road kills-to-spawners ratio (R/S) as a working measure of the impact of road mortality on a local population. While the R/S ratio may not reflect the losses to an entire local amphibian population, it is free of the errors of whole-population estimates, which are notoriously difficult for amphibians. When corrected for species-specific road-kill recordability, most results suggest that the impact of roads on newts may have been under-estimated and that the impact on common frog populations may be higher than on those of common toads.},

This report presents a five-year review of the progress achieved through implementation of the Code of Practice for the Environmental Management of Road Salts. The Code was published in the Canada Gazette in April 2004 under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 with the objective of ensuring environmental protection while maintaining roadway safety. The Code was developed by Environment Canada through a multi-stakeholder consultation process involving stakeholders from across Canada, representing the federal, provincial/territorial and municipal transportation sectors; industry; the Transportation Association of Canada; environmental groups; and universities. The objective of this review is to determine whether the Code has been effective in increasing the level of implementation of best practices for managing road salts, and in preventing and reducing the negative environmental impacts of road salts in Canada. Through this review, Environment Canada also identifies future actions needed to improve risk management for road salts. Acknowledgements -- Executive summary -- 1. Introduction -- 2.

  abstract = {A framework is constructed for how to relate ecosystem services to environmental justice. The benefits humans and society can derive from biophysical processes cannot be viewed as objectively existing ``out there'', but as entangled in social and political processes. This is unpacked through the analytical moments of generation, distribution and articulation of ecosystem services. Social practice moderates the generation of benefits from biophysical processes (through urban development patterns and day-to-day management of urban ecosystems), but also who in society that benefits from them, i.e. the distribution of ecosystem services (viewed here as the temporal and spatial scales at which it is possible for humans to benefit from biophysical processes). Moreover, for biophysical processes to attain value in decisionmaking, a social practice of value articulation is needed. The framework then moves between two levels of analysis. At the city-wide level, an ecological network translates how urban `green' areas, viewed as nodes, are interconnected by ecological flows (water, species movement, etc.) where nodes have different protective and management capacities. The network captures spatial complexity\textemdash what happens in one location, can have effects elsewhere. At the local level, urban struggles over land-use are studied to trace how actors utilize artifacts and social arenas to articulate how certain biophysical processes are of value. Competing networks of value articulation strive to influence land-use, and multiple local studies bring understanding of how power operates locally, informing city-wide analyses. Empirical studies from Stockholm, Cape Town and other cities inform the framework.},

Models of community organization involve variations of the top-down (predator control) or bottom-up (nutrient limitation) hypotheses. Verbal models, however, can be interpreted in different ways leading to confusion. Therefore, we predict from first principles the range of possible trophic level interactions, and define mathematically the instantaneous effects of experimental perturbations. Some of these interactions are logically and biologically unfeasible. The remaining set of 27 feasible models is based on an initial assumption, for simplicity, of linear interactions between trophic levels. Many more complex and non-linear models are logically feasible but, for parsimony, simple ones are tested first. We use an experiment in the boreal forest of Canada to test predictions of instantaneous changes to trophic levels and distinguish between competing models. Seven different perturbations systematically removed each trophic level or, for some levels, supplemented them. The predictions resulting from the perturbations were concerned with the direction of change in biomass in the other levels. The direct effects of each perturbation produced strong top-down and bottom-up changes in biomass. At both the vegetation and herbivore levels top-down was stronger than bottom-up despite some compensatory growth stimulated by herbivory. The combination of experiments produced results consistent with two-way (reciprocal) interactions at each level. Indirect effects on one or two levels removed from the perturbation were either very weak or undetectable. Top-down effects were strong when direct but attenuated quickly. Bottom-up effects were less strong but persisted as indirect effects to higher levels. Although the 'pure reciprocal' model best fits our results for the boreal forest system different models may apply to different ecosystems around the world. Studies of biological communities ask two main questions: (1) how are they structured, and (2) how do they function? These questions are relevant to conservation of both natural ecosystems and systems which have been subjected to change from human activities-eutrophication of lakes, acid rain pollution of lakes and forests, clearcutting of forests, introduction of exotic species, and creation of protected areas as islands within human ecosystems are some examples. We need to identify the major parts that hold the system together , the direction and strength of their interactions, and the components that are most sensitive to change},

In some ecological systems connectivity does not follow nearness relations defined by Euclidean distances, so distance must be measured another way. Least-cost modelling is a technique that can incorporate traversal costs across a landscape to measure the least-cost distance between locations as a function of both the distance travelled and the costs traversed. There has been a significant increase in the interest and use of least-cost modelling by ecologists in the last decade. However, perhaps because early applications of least-cost modelling in ecology tended to cite the method with reference to geographic information system software rather than the geographical science literature, ecologists are not currently making full use of available least-cost modelling techniques that have continued to develop. This review aims to describe the concepts of least-cost modelling, demonstrate current applications of least-cost modelling in landscape ecology, and to suggest future opportunities by linking the ecological application of least-cost modelling with recent geographical science developments from which least-cost modelling originally developed.},

Understanding habitat use of hares can help predict how hares and their predators will be affected by disturbances such as climate change, which will have a particularly strong effect at tree line. We examined hare activity at arctic tree line near Churchill, Manitoba, using fecal pellet transects established in August 2012. We counted all hare fecal pellets at two plots per transect and measured plant abundance and vegetation structure surrounding the plots, then used model selection to determine the combinations of habitat features or plant species that best explained hare activity or presence. Hare pellets occurred at a higher density where tall shrub cover was high. Pellet density also increased with increasing canopy cover, tree size, tree density, visibility, and small shrub cover, but was negatively correlated with medium-sized shrub and herb cover. Hares preferred areas with willow (genus Salix L.) and avoided areas with unpalatable black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Sterns \& Poggenb.). With climate warming, tree line is expected to advance northward and the increased tall shrub and willow cover predicted with increasing temperatures should benefit hares by providing greater predator protection and food.},

Landscape spatial structure is the spatial relationship among habitat patches and the matrix in which they are embedded. Many general models of subdivided populations make the assumptions that (1) all habitat patches are equivalent in size and quality and (2) all local populations (in the patches) are equally accessible by dispersers. Models that gloss over spatial details of landscape structure can be useful for theoretical developments but will almost always be misleading when applied to real-world conservation problems. We show that local extinctions of fragmented populations are common. From this it follows that recolonization of local extinctions is critical for regional survival of fragmented populations. The probability of recolonization depends on (1) spatial relationships among landscape elements used by the population, including habitat patches for breeding and elements of the inter-patch matrix through which dispersers move, (2) dispersal characteristics of the organism of interest, and (3) temporal changes in the landscape structure. For endangered species, which are typically restricted in their dispersal range and in the kinds of habitat through which they can disperse, these factors are of primary importance and must be explicitly considered in management decisions.},

A nationwide survey was conducted of highway maintenance agencies to rank the advantages of specific deicers with respect to low cost per lane/mile, low effective temperature, high ice-melting capacity, ease of application, and overall safety benefits for winter roads based on field experience or research from the respondent's agency. According to the results, most responding maintenance agencies still depend on chlorides and abrasives for snow and ice control. Less than 25\% of the survey respondents used alternative deicers such as potassium acetate, calcium magnesium acetate, sodium acetate, and potassium formate. The average ranking results show agricultural product-based deicers being the most advantageous, abrasives being the least and no significant difference between chlorides and acetates/formates based on the perceived advantages. Users were also asked to rank the disadvantages of specific deicers with respect to corrosion to metal, impacts on concrete and asphalt pavements, impacts on water quality, impacts on soil, vegetation, wildlife and human health, and overall effects to structures and the environment. The average ranking results show that acetates and formates in general were perceived to have the least impacts and chlorides the most. Literature and experimental data indicated that the negative impacts of acetates and formates were greater than perceived by survey respondents, especially with respect to damage to pavement, structures and water quality. As such, CDOT has decided not to use available potassium or other acetate compounds.}

In addition to monitoring Odonata, several environmental variables were assessed, including an index based on macroinvertebrate communities (IBMWP). In April 1998, this river system suffered from an accidental release of a large mass of toxic mining waste, which exterminated macroinvertebrates in the middle and lower parts and floodplain. Several years later, dragonfly communities in these areas were simi-lar to those of unaffected upper reaches. Communities of sites less affected by gen-eral human impact were dominated by semivoltine anisopterans. In contrast, headwaters and river reaches where riparian forest had been destroyed many years ago and seasonality of river discharge was boosted by landscape management har-boured chiefly uni-or bivoltine species, regardless whether a site had been affected by mining waste or not. Species assemblage was especially poor in lower river reaches that experienced permanent, diffuse urban and agricultural pollution. A few parti-voltine species were recorded, but only in habitats with a high IBMWP index.

  abstract = {The concept of an animal's home range has evolved over time, as have methods for estimating home-range size and shape. Recently, home-range estimation methods have focused on estimating an animal's utilization distribution (UD; i.e., the probability distribution defining the animal's use of space). We illustrate the importance of the utilization distribution in characterizing the degree of overlap between home ranges (e.g., when assessing site fidelity or space-use sharing among individuals). We compare several different statistics for their ability to accurately rank paired examples in terms of their degree of overlap. These examples illustrate limitations of indices commonly used to quantify home-range overlap and suggest that new overlap indices that are a function of the UD are likely to be more informative. We suggest 2 new statistics for measuring home-range overlap: (1) for a measure of space-use sharing, we suggest a generalization of Hurlbert's (1978) E/Euniform statistic, which we term the utilization distribution overlap index (UDOI), and (2) for a general measure of similarity between UD estimates, we suggest Bhattacharyya's affinity (BA; Bhattacharyya 1943). Using a short simulation study, we found that overlap indices can accurately rank pairs of UDs in terms of the extent of overlap, but estimates of overlap indices are likely to be biased. The extent of the bias depended on sample size and the degree of overlap (UDs with a high degree of overlap resulted in statistics that were more biased low), suggesting that comparisons across studies may be problematic. We illustrate the use of overlap indices to quantify the degree of similarity among UD estimates obtained using 2 different data collection methods (Global Positioning Systems GPS and very high frequency VHF radiotelemetry) for an adult female northern white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in north-central Minnesota.},

We tested the effects of land use on the dispersal capacity of stream macroinvertebrates through local and regional processes. Location In all, 183 Brazilian headwater stream sites, located in the Neotropical Savanna with variable land use and covering a total area of 46,394 km2. Taxon Stream macroinvertebrates Methods We used multiple regression models for distance matrices to identify the relative importance of environmental and landscape characteristics to explain community dissimilarity of stream macroinvertebrates with different mobility traits. As predictors, we calculated four distance metrics: environmental distance describing the dissimilarity in local conditions, the network distance accounting for distances across the drainage system and two distances measuring landscape resistance to dispersal (topographic and land use). We classified macroinvertebrates in dispersal groups according to their dispersal abilities (flying and drifting) and life story traits (voltinism, adult life span and body size). We tested the effects of these distances on all taxa and on the different dispersal groups, to explore whether biological traits would result in different metacommunity patterns. Results Our hierarchical clustering analysis identified five macroinvertebrate dispersal groups. The dispersal group 1 was mainly composed by aquatic obligate taxa, dispersal group 2 by taxa with low drift propensity, dispersal group 3 represented taxa with high directional flight capacity, dispersal group 4 included taxa with medium drift propensity and dispersal group 5 represented taxa with high drift propensity. We found that environmental distance and land use distance were the most important predictors explaining community dissimilarity for most of the dispersal groups. Main conclusion The metacommunity patterns found in this study suggest that environmental filtering was the most important community assembly mechanism at a local scale, whereas land use could constrain dispersal at the regional scale. Understanding these processes is crucial to meet conservation and restoration goals, especially in biodiversity hotspots. Our results reinforce the importance of considering entire catchments for preserving stream health and aquatic biodiversity and indicate the need for a much more integrative research between terrestrial and aquatic ecology.},

Yet, the question remains as to whether the recreational opportunities of parks meet the demands of increasingly multicultural societies and whether recreational patterns vary at spatial scales. In a pan-European survey, we assessed how people use urban parks (in five cities, N = 3814) and how recreational patterns relate to respondents' sociocultural and geographical contexts (using 19 explanatory variables). Our results show that across Europe (i) respondents share a general pattern in their recreational activities with a prevalence for the physical uses of parks, especially taking a walk; (ii) the geographic context matters, demonstrating a high variety of uses across the cities; and that (iii) the sociocultural context is also important; e.g., the occupation and biodiversity valuations of respondents are significantly associated with the uses performed. The sociocultural context matters particularly for physical park uses and is associated to a lesser extent with nature-related uses. Given that our results attest to a high variety of park uses between sociocultural groups and the geographical context, we conclude that it is important to consider the specific backgrounds of people to enhance recreational ecosystem services in greenspace development.},

We test this premise for wolverines (Gulo gulo luscus L., 1758) at the edge of their Rocky Mountain range in Alberta, Canada, a mosaic of natural heterogeneity and extensive landscape development. As wolverines have a suspected negative response to human activity, we hypothesized their occurrence on the Rockies' slopes is predicted by a combination of natural and anthropogenic features. We surveyed wolverines at 120 sites along a natural and anthropogenic gradient using hair trapping and noninvasive genetic tagging. We used abundance estimation, generalized linear, and hierarchical models to determine whether abundance and occurrence was best predicted by natural land cover, topography, footprint, or a combination. Wolverines were more abundant in rugged areas protected from anthropogenic development. Wolverines were less likely to occur at sites with oil and gas exploration, forest harvest, or burned areas, even after accounting for the effect of topography. The relative paucity of wolverines in human-impacted portions of this range edge suggests that effective conservation requires managing landscape development, and research on the proximal mechanisms behind this relationship.},

Empirically, linking reproductive success with landscape structure and anthropogenic change is a first step in understanding and managing the spatial mechanisms that affect reproduction, but this link is not sufficiently informed by data. Hierarchical multistate occupancy models can forge these links by estimating spatial patterns of reproductive success across landscapes. To illustrate, we surveyed the occurrence of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Canadian Rocky Mountains Alberta, Canada. We deployed camera traps for 6 weeks at 54 surveys sites in different types of land cover. We used hierarchical multistate occupancy models to estimate probability of detection, grizzly bear occupancy, and probability of reproductive success at each site. Grizzly bear occupancy varied among cover types and was greater in herbaceous alpine ecotones than in low-elevation wetlands or mid-elevation conifer forests. The conditional probability of reproductive success given grizzly bear occupancy was 30\% (SE = 0.14). Grizzly bears with cubs had a higher probability of detection than grizzly bears without cubs, but sites were correctly classified as being occupied by breeding females 49\% of the time based on raw data and thus would have been underestimated by half. Repeated surveys and multistate modeling reduced the probability of misclassifying sites occupied by breeders as unoccupied to {$<$}2\%. The probability of breeding grizzly bear occupancy varied across the landscape. Those patches with highest probabilities of breeding occupancy-herbaceous alpine ecotones-were small and highly dispersed and are projected to shrink as treelines advance due to climate warming. Understanding spatial correlates in breeding distribution is a key requirement for species conservation in the face of climate change and can help identify priorities for landscape management and protection.

Considerable statistical effort has gone into estimating sources of heterogeneity, but detection error\textendash arising when a visiting bear fails to leave a hair sample\textendash has not been independently estimated. We used camera traps to survey griz-zly bear occurrence at fixed hair traps and multi-method hierarchical occupancy models to estimate the probability that a visiting bear actually leaves a hair sample with viable DNA. We surveyed grizzly bears via hair trapping and camera trapping for 8 monthly surveys at 50 (2012) and 76 (2013) sites in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. We used multi-method occupancy models to estimate site occupancy, probability of detection, and condi-tional occupancy at a hair trap. We tested the prediction that detection error in NGT studies could be induced by temporal variability within season, leading to underestimation of occu-pancy. NGT via hair trapping consistently underestimated grizzly bear occupancy at a site when compared to camera trapping. At best occupancy was underestimated by 50\%; at worst, by 95\%. Probability of false absence was reduced through successive surveys, but this mainly accounts for error imparted by movement among repeated surveys, not neces-sarily missed detections by extant bears. The implications of missed detections and biased occupancy estimates for density estimation\textendash which form the crux of management plans\textendash{} require consideration.

The 1999 growing season had precipitation (226.9 mm) near the 30-year average value (1971-2000; 206.4 {$\pm$} 77.5; mean {$\pm$} S.D.). In contrast, the 1998 growing season precipitation (295.3 mm) was significantly above average and almost four times greater than the 2000 growing season precipitation (75.1 mm), which was significantly below average. The 1998 growing season had higher peak evapotranspiration (4.5 mm per day) than values observed in 1999 and 2000, when the highest evapotranspiration was approximately 3 mm per day. Evapotranspiration during the winter periods was normally {$<$}0.5 mm per day. In 1998, maximum latent heat flux was higher than sensible heat flux during June and early July. In contrast, sensible heat flux dominated the energy budget at midday during the entire 1999 and 2000 growing seasons. The soil heat flux component was quite similar during all 3 years, with maximum daily values reaching approximately 80-100 W m-2. The decoupling coefficient (ranged between 0.2 and 0.3) indicated that evapotranspiration was strongly controlled by surface conductance in this grassland. The highest {$\lambda$}E/{$\lambda$}Eeq values (0.7-0.8) occurred in June and July 1998, before the exhaustion of soil moisture reduced values to {$<$}0.4 in late August. Lower values were recorded in 1999 and 2000, often below 0.5. A non-linear model of surface conductance that included functions for vapor pressure deficit, photon flux density, and available soil moisture explained a large proportion of the variation in the surface conductance data. To model surface conductance accurately, separate model coefficients need to be used for the different years. Therefore, our data indicate that evapotranspiration and its physiological control vary in response to interannual changes in precipitation. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Quantifying animals' home ranges is a key problem in ecology and has important conservation and wildlife management applications. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a workhorse technique for range delineation problems that is both statistically efficient and nonparametric. KDE assumes that the data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, animal tracking data, which are routinely used as inputs to KDEs, are inherently autocorrelated and violate this key assumption. As we demonstrate, using realistically autocorrelated data in conventional KDEs results in grossly underestimated home ranges. We further show that the performance of conventional KDEs actually degrades as data quality improves, because autocorrelation strength increases as movement paths become more finely resolved. To remedy these flaws with the traditional KDE method, we derive an autocorrelated KDE (AKDE) from first principles to use autocorrelated data, making it perfectly suited for movement data sets. We illustrate the vastly improved performance of AKDE using analytical arguments, relocation data from Mongolian gazelles, and simulations based upon the gazelle's observed movement process. By yielding better minimum area estimates for threatened wildlife populations, we believe that future widespread use of AKDE will have significant impact on ecology and conservation biology.},

Currently, area estimates are obtained indirectly, by first estimating the location distribution from tracking (home range) or survey (geographic range) data and then estimating areas from that distribution. This indirect approach leads to biased area estimates and difficulty in deriving reasonable confidence intervals. 2. We introduce a new kernel density estimator (and associated confidence intervals) focused specifically on area estimation that applies to both independently sampled survey data and autocorrelated tracking data. We test our methods against simulated movement data and demonstrate its use with African buffalo data. 3. The area-corrected kernel density estimator produces much more accurate area estimates, particularly at small sample sizes, and the newly derived confidence intervals are more reliable than existing alternatives. 4. This new method is the most efficient nonparametric home-range estimator for animal tracking data and should also be considered when calculating nonparametric range estimates from survey data. This estimator is now the default method in the CTMM R package.},

  abstract = {1. Technological advances have steadily increased the detail of animal tracking data-sets, yet fundamental data limitations exist for many species that cause substantial biases in home-range estimation. Specifically, the effective sample size of a range estimate is proportional to the number of observed range crossings, not the number of sampled locations. Currently, the most accurate home-range estima-tors condition on an autocorrelation model, for which the standard estimation frameworks are based on likelihood functions, even though these methods are known to underestimate variance-and therefore ranging area-when effective sample sizes are small. 2. Residual maximum likelihood (REML) is a widely used method for reducing bias in maximum-likelihood (ML) variance estimation at small sample sizes. Unfortunately, we find that REML is too unstable for practical application to continuous-time movement models. When the effective sample size N is decreased to N {$\leq$} (10), which is common in tracking applications, REML undergoes a sudden divergence in variance estimation. To avoid this issue, while retaining REML's first-order bias correction, we derive a family of estimators that leverage REML to make a pertur-bative correction to ML. We also derive AIC values for REML and our estimators, including cases where model structures differ, which is not generally understood to be possible. 3. Using both simulated data and GPS data from lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), we show how our perturbative estimators are more accurate than traditional ML and REML methods. Specifically, when (5) home-range crossings are observed, REML is unreliable by orders of magnitude, ML home ranges are \textasciitilde 30\% underestimated, and our perturbative estimators yield home ranges that are only \textasciitilde 10\% underestimated. A parametric bootstrap can then reduce the ML and perturbative home-range underestimation to \textasciitilde 10\% and \textasciitilde 3\%, respectively. 4. Home-range estimation is one of the primary reasons for collecting animal tracking data, and small effective sample sizes are a more common problem than is currently realized. The methods introduced here allow for more accurate movement model and home-range estimation at small effective sample sizes, and thus fill an important role for animal movement analysis.

  abstract = {Network analysis is on the rise across scientific disciplines because of its ability to reveal complex, and often emergent, patterns and dynamics. Nonetheless, a growing concern in network analysis is the use of limited data for constructing networks. This concern is strikingly relevant to ecology and conservation biology, where network analysis is used to infer connectivity across landscapes. In this context, movement among patches is the crucial parameter for interpreting connectivity but because of the difficulty of collecting reliable movement data, most network analysis proceeds with only indirect information on movement across landscapes rather than using observed movement to construct networks. Statistical models developed for social networks provide promising alternatives for landscape network construction because they can leverage limited movement information to predict linkages. Using two mark-recapture datasets on individual movement and connectivity across landscapes, we test whether commonly used network constructions for interpreting connectivity can predict actual linkages and network structure, and we contrast these approaches to social network models. We find that currently applied network constructions for assessing connectivity consistently, and substantially, overpredict actual connectivity, resulting in considerable overestimation of metapopulation lifetime. Furthermore, social network models provide accurate predictions of network structure, and can do so with remarkably limited data on movement. Social network models offer a flexible and powerful way for not only understanding the factors influencing connectivity but also for providing more reliable estimates of connectivity and metapopulation persistence in the face of limited data.},

  abstract = {The shape, size, and content of MC carbides in a unidirectional Ni-base superalloy have been studied at different solidification rates using material of normal commercial composition (5 ppm nitrogen) and two melts with additions to produce 22 and 30 ppm nitrogen. M(C,N) was found in nitrogendoped specimens. The increased nitrogen content results in a change in carbide morphology from acicular or Chinese-script type to a blocky one. Carbide size increases from 6.85 to 7.25 {$\mu$}m at 2.5 {$\mu$}m/s and from 2.31 to 2.81 {$\mu$}m at 200 {$\mu$}m/s as the nitrogen content increases from 5 to 22 ppm; carbide size is reduced to 5.2 {$\mu$}m at 2.5 {$\mu$}/s and to 2.1 {$\mu$}m at 200 {$\mu$}m/s when nitrogen content is further raised to 30 ppm. There is no evident change in carbide content (area percentage) with increase of nitrogen. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis revealed characteristic centers in some of the blocky carbides of TiN, as nuclei of MC or M(C,N) formed in the melt. The influences of nitrogen on carbide at the low solidification rate are stronger than those at the higher rate. With the increase of solidification rate, the carbide turns from bar to Chinese-script type, except for the base alloy at 2.5 {$\mu$}m/s, and the content and size decrease.},

Indeed how is ecology - including its urban water, soil, air, plant, and animal foundations - spatially entwined with this great human enterprise? And how can we improve urban areas for both nature and people? Urban Ecology: Science of Cities explores the entire urban area: from streets, lawns, and parks to riversides, sewer systems, and industrial sites. The book presents models, patterns, and examples from hundreds of cities worldwide. Numerous illustrations enrich the presentation. Cities are analyzed, not as ecologically bad or good, but as places with concentrated rather than dispersed people. Urban ecology principles, traditionally adapted from natural-area ecology, now increasingly emerge from the distinctive features of cities. Spatial patterns and flows, linking organisms, built structures, and the physical environment highlight a treasure chest of useful principles. This pioneering interdisciplinary book opens up frontiers of insight, as a valuable source and text for undergraduates, graduates, researchers, professionals, and others with a thirst for solutions to growing urban problems.},

Using long-term monitoring data of butterfly assemblages, we tested the effects of the amount and distribution of semi-natural habitat (SNH), moderated by species traits, on climate-driven species turnover. We found that spatially dispersed SNH favoured the colonisation of warm-adapted and mobile species. In contrast, extinction risk of cold-adapted species increased in dispersed (as opposed to aggregated) habitats and when the amount of SNH was low. Strengthening habitat networks by maintaining or creating stepping-stone patches could thus allow warm-adapted species to expand their range, while increasing the area of natural habitat and its spatial cohesion may be important to aid the local persistence of species threatened by a warming climate.},

This surprisingly high subtropical carbon uptake cannot be fully accounted for by sediment trap-collected sinking particles and the downward mixing of suspended and dissolved organic carbon. We propose an explanation for these paradoxical observations: gel-like organic matter rich in carbon but poor in nutrients, akin to transparent exopolymer particles, is produced by phytoplankton under nutrient limitation, and a portion sinks into the shallow subsurface, where it is respired by heterotrophic bacteria. This organic matter would evade detection by sediment traps, effectively representing an additional (sinking-driven) source of dissolved organic carbon to the subsurface. Building on existing evidence for the production of such nutrient-poor organic matter in surface waters, we describe evidence for its decomposition in the shallow subsurface of the Sargasso Sea. First, oxygen at these depths is consumed over the summer without comparable production of nitrate. Second, a seasonal change in the},

DISCUSSION: We identify research questions in seven domains: a) mechanistic biomedical studies; b) exposure science; c) epidemiology of health benefits; d) diversity and equity considerations; e) technological nature; f) economic and policy studies; and g) implementation science. CONCLUSIONS: Nature contact may offer a range of human health benefits. Although much evidence is already available, much remains unknown.

In spite of that longer times are usually required compared with physicochemical strategies, complete degradation of the pollutant can be achieved, and no further confinement of polluted matrix is needed. Microbial aerobic degradation is achieved by the incorporation of molecular oxygen into the inert hydrocarbon molecule and funneling intermediates into central catabolic pathways. Several families of alkane monooxygenases and ring hydroxylating dioxygenases are distributed mainly among Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Fungi strains. Catabolic routes, regulatory networks, and tolerance/resistance mechanisms have been characterized in model hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria to understand and optimize their metabolic capabilities, providing the basis to enhance microbial fitness in order to improve hydrocarbon removal. However, microbial communities taken as a whole play a key role in hydrocarbon pollution events. Microbial community dynamics during biodegradation is crucial for understanding how they respond and adapt to pollution and remediation. Several strategies have been applied worldwide for the recovery of sites contaminated with persistent organic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and petroleum derivatives. Common strategies include controlling environmental variables (e.g., oxygen availability, hydrocarbon solubility, nutrient balance) and managing hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms, in order to overcome the rate-limiting factors that slow down hydrocarbon biodegradation.},

  abstract = {We documented the relative grain at which Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) perceive habitat heterogeneity using fractal dimension of foraging paths. We evaluated whether lynx expended greater foraging effort (i.e., greater fractal dimension of movement paths) in patches with the highest density of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), or in patches with intermediate densities of prey where lower stem densities and greater visibility promote increased mobility and access to prey. Lynx foraged within patches with intermediate to high hare density and intermediate cover for hares, and thus, attempted to maximize access to prey rather than exposure to habitats with highest prey density but optimal escape cover. Fractal dimension of movement paths was greater within preferred than in nonpreferred habitats and corresponded with higher foraging success in preferred habitats. Movement paths were more tortuous at broader than finer scales, suggesting that lynx were exhibiting stronger coarse-grained than fine-grained habitat preferences. Higher fractal dimension of movement paths reduced the number of transitions between patches of higher and lower foraging quality, resulting in individual movement patterns matching the scale of interpatch variation in hare abundance and accessibility within home ranges. Lynx made their strongest foraging decisions when exhibiting higher-order resource selection, so focusing conservation efforts to alter within-patch structure may be less effective than creating patch-and landscape-scale conditions that enhance foraging success. Coarse-grained resource selection by wide-ranging carnivores may reduce the importance of fine-scale conservation efforts and emphasizes the importance of focusing conservation for these coarse-grained species on factors influencing home-range quality and maintenance of viable landscapes. Spatial processes in predator-prey systems can be influenced greatly by behaviors (Bergman et al. 2006) such as complex movement of predators while foraging and traveling within and between patches. Movement decisions are affected by availability, distribution, detectability, and vulnerability of prey; thus, quantification of spatial decision-making by predators can enhance understanding of habitat choices and predator-prey interactions (Swingland and Greenwood 1983). Evaluation of path tortuosity of individual animals has been used to interpret intraspecific perceptions of landscapes (Crist et al. 1992; With 1994), where the complexity of movement paths relates to the frequency of encountering resources (Sugihara and May 1990) and energy investment (Bascompte and Vil\`a 1997). Fractal dimension quantifies path tortuousity for continuous movement paths and derives values of 1 when paths are straight to a maximum of 2 when a path is so tortuous as to completely cover a plane (Nams and Bourgeois 2004). Recent studies have used fractal dimension to provide unique insights into habitat (Newbury and Nelson 2007; Phillips et al. 2004; Saeki et al. 2007; Webb et al. 2009), gender (Webb et al. 2009), prey (Newbury and Nelson 2007), and scalar effects (Webb et al. 2009) on movement paths of wide-ranging mammals using consecutive telemetry fixes. However, these studies did not evaluate fine-scale movement behaviors because of imprecision caused by both time elapsed between consecutive fixes and inherent telemetry errors. Recent advances in spatial technologies (e.g., continuous-sampling global positioning systems [GPSs]) have aided quantification w w w. m a m m a l o g y. o r g},

We hypothesized most cities would score poorly on diversity benchmarks and spatial patterns in species composition would exist, as illustrated by established relationships between urban density and urban tree diversity. Results indicate city centers were less likely to approach the proposed diversity benchmarks than outside the city center. Overall, both Shannon and Simpson diversity indices show greater diversity outside of the city center, especially at the species-level. Understanding street tree diversity and spatial variation patterns across cities internationally can offer needed evidence to back up heuristic benchmarks.

Theory predicts that if essential resources are heterogeneously distributed across a metacommunity, single species may dominate productivity in individual metacommunity patches, but a mixture of species will maximize productivity across the whole metacommunity. It also predicts that a balanced supply of resources within local patches should favor species coexistence, whereas resource imbalance would favor the dominance of one species. We performed an experiment with five freshwater algal species to study the effects of total supply of resources, their ratios, and species richness on biovolume production and evenness at the scale of both local patches and metacommunities. Generally, algal biovolume increased, whereas algal resource use efficiency (RUE) and evenness decreased with increasing total supply of resources in mixed communities containing all five species. In contrast to predictions for biovolume production, the species mixtures did not outperform all monocultures at the scale of metacommunities. In other words, we observed no general transgressive overyielding. However, RUE was always higher in mixtures than predicted from monocultures, and analyses indicate that resource partitioning or facilitation in mixtures resulted in higher-than-expected productivity at high resource supply. Contrasting our predictions for the local scale, balanced supply of resources did not generally favor higher local evenness, however lowest evenness was confined to patches with the most imbalanced supply. Thus, our study provides mixed support for recent theoretical advancements to understand biodiversity-productivity relationships.},

  abstract = {1. Concomitant with the rise in the proportion of the global human population that resides in urban areas has been growth in awareness of the importance of the provision of ecosystem goods and services to those people. Urban areas are themselves of significance in this regard because of their areal extent, and hence the quantity of services falling within their bounds, and because of the need for local provision of services to urban residents. 2. Here, we review key challenges to the effective management of ecosystem goods and services within urban areas. 3. These challenges include the structure of green space, its temporal dynamics, spatial constraint on ecosystem service flows, occurrence of novel forms of flows, large numbers of land managers, conflicting management goals, possible differences between perceptions of urban dwellers and the reality of the distribution and flow of ecosystem services, and the 'wicked' nature of the problem of ecosystem service management. 4. Synthesis and applications. Urban areas present very particular combinations of challenges and opportunities for the management of ecosystem goods and services. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of green spaces greatly complicates the maintenance and improvement in service provision as well as dramatically inflating costs. Spatial constraints on ecosystem service flows mean that these can be highly dependent on the maintenance of particular areas of connectivity, but also that provision of additional key points of connectivity may be disproportionately beneficial to those flows. The existence of novel forms of flows of ecosystem services in urban areas offers means of overcoming spatial constraints on more natural flows, but will require the development of new kinds of ecosystem process models to inform their design and management. The large numbers of land managers, conflicts between the best approaches for managing for different goods and services, and frequent differences between the perceptions of urban dwellers and the reality of urban landscapes create a complex management context. The management of ecosystem goods and services is closely allied to the challenges of conventional urban planning. However, applied ecology has a broad range of tools available to assist in determining solutions, including the use of high-resolution remote sensing techniques, landscape ecology principles and theory (e.g. patch and matrix frameworks, meta-population models), and systematic conservation planning approaches.},

  abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems are degraded by a variety of pressures as a result of the growing human population. Global-scale impacts include homogenization of biological communities, removal of top predators and ecosystem engineers, chemical pollution by excess nutrients and contaminants as well as deteriorating structural diversity, connectivity and process dynamics. There is a pressing societal need to reverse the decline in biodiversity and replace lost ecosystem functioning and services in aquatic ecosystems by enabling natural recovery or by active restoration. Common concepts and approaches for conservation, recovery and restoration in freshwater and marine ecosystems, aided by recent advances in ecological theory, include decision criteria on priorities for conservation, harnessing natural recovery by cessation of impacts, restoring connectivity and meso-habitat diversity as well as the geomorphological structural template including hydrodynamic processes. Re-oligotrophication at catchment or regional sea-scale benefits from integrating freshwater and marine restoration. Species or assemblages that convey biogenic structure or act as ecosystem engineers and keystone species should be given priority. Top-down control can be reinstated in closed systems. Differences between freshwater and marine ecosystems include the greater spatial restriction of many species in fresh water, the importance of rooted vegetation and insects in freshwater, and the much greater dispersal and connectivity in marine systems. These differences dictate different approaches, with more scope for active restoration work in fresh water and harnessing natural recovery in marine systems. Restoration schemes need clearly defined target states. They should generally take a process-oriented and stepwise adaptive management approach judging success against reference or control sites. Societal and political expectations need to be managed and restoration schemes should not promise too much. Even minor rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems can put back some biodiversity and key services.

  abstract = {Background: Characterizing animal space use is critical for understanding ecological relationships. Animal telemetry technology has revolutionized the fields of ecology and conservation biology by providing high quality spatial data on animal movement. Radio-telemetry with very high frequency (VHF) radio signals continues to be a useful technology because of its low cost, miniaturization, and low battery requirements. Despite a number of statistical developments synthetically integrating animal location estimation and uncertainty with spatial process models using satellite telemetry data, we are unaware of similar developments for azimuthal telemetry data. As such, there are few statistical options to handle these unique data and no synthetic framework for modeling animal location uncertainty and accounting for it in ecological models. We developed a hierarchical modeling framework to provide robust animal location estimates from one or more intersecting or non-intersecting azimuths. We used our azimuthal telemetry model (ATM) to account for azimuthal uncertainty with covariates and propagate location uncertainty into spatial ecological models. We evaluate the ATM with commonly used estimators (Lenth (1981) maximum likelihood and M-Estimators) using simulation. We also provide illustrative empirical examples, demonstrating the impact of ignoring location uncertainty within home range and resource selection analyses. We further use simulation to better understand the relationship among location uncertainty, spatial covariate autocorrelation, and resource selection inference. Results: We found the ATM to have good performance in estimating locations and the only model that has appropriate measures of coverage. Ignoring animal location uncertainty when estimating resource selection or home ranges can have pernicious effects on ecological inference. Home range estimates can be overly confident and conservative when ignoring location uncertainty and resource selection coefficients can lead to incorrect inference and over confidence in the magnitude of selection. Furthermore, our simulation study clarified that incorporating location uncertainty helps reduce bias in resource selection coefficients across all levels of covariate spatial autocorrelation. Conclusion: The ATM can accommodate one or more azimuths when estimating animal locations, regardless of how they intersect; this ensures that all data collected are used for ecological inference. Our findings and model development have important implications for interpreting historical analyses using this type of data and the future design of radio-telemetry studies.},

The evidence of this problem is not uniform however, and evidence of inequity varies in size and significance across studies. This variation in results suggests the need for a research synthesis and meta-analysis. We employed a systematic literature search to identify original studies which examined the relationship between urban forest cover and income (n = 61) and coded each effect size (n = 332). We used meta-analytic techniques to estimate the average (unconditional) relationship between urban forest cover and income and to estimate the impact that methodological choices, measurement, publication characteristics, and study site characteristics had on the magnitude of that relationship. We leveraged variation in study methodology to evaluate the extent to which results were sensitive to methodological choices often debated in the geographic and environmental justice literature but not yet evaluated in environmental amenities research.},

  abstract = {Parametric kernel methods currently dominate the literature regarding the construction of animal home ranges (HRs) and utilization distributions (UDs). These methods frequently fail to capture the kinds of hard boundaries common to many natural systems. Recently a local convex hull (LoCoH) nonparametric kernel method, which generalizes the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method, was shown to be more appropriate than parametric kernel methods for constructing HRs and UDs, because of its ability to identify hard boundaries (e.g., rivers, cliff edges) and convergence to the true distribution as sample size increases. Here we extend the LoCoH in two ways: ''fixed sphere-of-influence,'' or r-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a fixed radius r of each reference point), and an ''adaptive sphere-of-influence,'' or a-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a radius a such that the distances of all points within the radius to the reference point sum to a value less than or equal to a), and compare them to the original ''fixed-number-of-points,'' or k-LoCoH (all kernels constructed from k-1 nearest neighbors of root points). We also compare these nonparametric LoCoH to parametric kernel methods using manufactured data and data collected from GPS collars on African buffalo in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results demonstrate that LoCoH methods are superior to parametric kernel methods in estimating areas used by animals, excluding unused areas (holes) and, generally, in constructing UDs and HRs arising from the movement of animals influenced by hard boundaries and irregular structures (e.g., rocky outcrops). We also demonstrate that a-LoCoH is generally superior to k-and r-LoCoH (with software for all three methods available at http://},

This population occupies different habitat types, experiences different environmental conditions, and are exposed to different predator species and densities than northern hare populations; therefore, they might exhibit differences in risk avoidance behaviors. We analyzed hare survival, movement rates, and habitat use under different levels of predation risk, as indexed by moonlight. Similar to previous work, we found snowshoe hare survival decreased with increased moon illumination during the winter, but we found differences in behavioral responses to increased predation risk. We found that snowshoe hares did not reduce movement rates during high-risk nights, but instead found that hares selected areas with denser canopy cover, compared to low-risk nights. We suggest that behavioral plasticity in response to predation risk allows populations of the same species to respond to localized conditions.},

Based upon analysis of the results of extensive field studies conducted by other investigators to characterize the dietary composition, foraging behavior, and contaminant levels in the predators and in their prey, 70-80 percent of the contaminant dose received by the peregrine falcon and 90-95 percent of the dose to the bald eagle originated within the Bight. Dynamic, mechanistic, bioenergetics-based bioaccumulation models for p,p 0-DDE and PCBs were developed for both species. Measured contaminant levels in predator eggs were found to be quantitatively consistent with measured levels in their prey, providing support for the estimates of dietary composition and foraging behavior, and therefore for the characterization of contaminant sources. Based on the model, most of the contaminant dose to the bald eagles on Santa Catalina Island is accumulated from sea lion carrion, and, based on a model of female sea lion bioaccumulation described in a companion publication, much of the dose to the sea lion originates in the more highly contaminated regions of the Bight which include the Palos Verdes Shelf and Santa Monica Bay. The importance of non-local contaminant sources to the eagle was surprising, since the eagles are non-migratory and forage locally on Santa Catalina, and consume 90 percent fish, most of which are nearshore species. A third model constructed for the double-crested cormorant indicated that cormorants from Anacapa Island are likely to feed to some degree in the more highly contaminated regions of the Bight near the Palos Verdes Shelf. In contrast, the cormorants from Santa Barbara Island probably feed less intensively in the more contaminated regions of the Bight than previously thought. The model framework developed here is generally applicable. It can aid in predicting the course of natural recovery and the impacts of remediation activities, and can provide quantitative exposure estimates for use in risk assessment. r},

In particular, we examined the occurrence of species of conservation concern at the European scale. 3. Results revealed that 92.6\% of all 81 Central European dragonfly species occurred in cities, as well as 85.7\% of 14 species of conservation concern. As expected, assemblages of city species were subsets of the regional species pool and city species richness increased with regional species numbers. Some cities hosted the complete regional species pool. 4. Ten species of conservation concern established autochthonous popula-tions and six of them, such as Aeshna viridis and Ophiogomphus cecilia, were abundant at least in single cities. 5. We conclude that there is good potential for cities to host high dragonfly diversity and even to promote species of conservation concern.

Indeed, elemental ratios are used as an index for functional differences between plants and their responses to natural or anthropogenic variations in nutrient supply. We investigated the variation in growth and elemental content of the rootless terrestrial bromeliad Tillandsia landbeckii, which obtains its moisture, and likely its nutrients, from coastal fogs in the Atacama Desert. We assessed (1) how fog nutrient supply influences plant growth and stoichiometry and (2) the response of plant growth and stoichiometry to variations in nutrient supply by using reciprocal transplants. We hypothesized that T. landbeckii should exhibit physiological and biochemical plastic responses commensurate with nutrient supply from atmospheric deposition. In the case of the Atacama Desert, nutrient supply from fog is variable over space and time, which suggests a relatively high variation in the growth and elemental content of atmospheric bromeliads. We found that the nutrient content of T. landbeckii showed high spatio-temporal variability, driven partially by fog nutrient deposition but also by plant growth rates. Reciprocal transplant experiments showed that transplanted individuals converged to similar nutrient content, growth rates, and leaf production of resident plants at each site, reflecting local nutrient availability. Although plant nutrient content did not exactly match the relative supply of N and P, our results suggest that atmospheric nutrient supply is a dominant driver of plant growth and stoichiometry. In fact, our results indicate that N uptake by T. landbeckii plants depends more on N supplied by fog, whereas P uptake is mainly regulated by within-plant nutrient demand for growth. Overall, these findings indicate that variation in fog nutrient supply exerts a strong control over growth and nutrient dynamics of atmospheric plants, which are ubiquitous across fog-dominated ecosystems.},

We manipulated detrital nutrient content by increasing N and P simultaneously or separately.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n* Chironomids and caddisflies showed faster growth rates when they fed on enriched detritus. Both N and P contents of the detritus limited the growth of chironomids, but combined effects were antagonistic (i.e. growth rates were less than expected according to single additions of N or P). By contrast, the growth of caddisflies was greater when fed on N-rich detritus, but was unaffected by P enrichment. These results suggest that under natural conditions, chironomids and caddisflies show reduced growth rates because they face strong nutrient limitation.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n* We also found that increased growth rates were correlated with an increase in the body P content of chironomids and caddisflies, which is consistent with the growth rate hypothesis. This hypothesis predicts that high body P content permits the rapid ribosomal RNA production needed for high growth rates. This study therefore provides some of the first direct evidence for the growth rate hypothesis in detrital systems. Although detritus quality was an important factor determining the growth of detritivores, it had no effect on the survival of these insects.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n* Our study highlights the importance of N and P additions as well as their interaction in constraining the growth of different consumers.

  abstract = {The niche concept is essential to understanding how biotic and abiotic factors regulate the abundance and distribution of living entities, and how these organisms utilize, affect and compete for resources in the environment. However, it has been challenging to determine the number and types of important niche dimensions. By contrast, there is strong mechanistic theory and empirical evidence showing that the elemental composition of living organisms shapes ecological systems, from organismal physiology to food web structure. We propose an approach based on a multidimensional elemental view of the ecological niche. Visualizing the stoichiometric composition of individuals in multivariate space permits quantification of niche dimensions within and across species. This approach expands on previous elemental characterizations of plant niches, and adapts metrics of niche volume, overlap and nestedness previously used to quantify isotopic niches. We demonstrate the applicability of the multidimensional stoichiometric niche using data on carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus of terrestrial and freshwater communities composed by multiple trophic groups. First, we calculated the stoichiometric niche volumes occupied by terrestrial and freshwater food webs, by trophic groups, by individual species, and by individuals within species, which together give a measure of the extent of stoichiometric diversity within and across levels of organization. Then we evaluated complementarity between these stoichiometric niches, through metrics of overlap and nestedness. Our case study showed that vertebrates, invertebrates, and primary producers do not overlap in their stoichiometric niches, and that large areas of stoichiometric space are unoccupied by organisms. Within invertebrates, niche differences emerged between freshwater and terrestrial food webs, and between herbivores and non-herbivores (detritivores and predators). These niche differences were accompanied by changes in the covariance structure of the three elements, suggesting fundamental shifts in organismal physiology and/or structure. We also demonstrate the sensitivity of results to sample size, and suggest that representative sampling is better than rarefaction in characterizing the stoichiometric niche occupied by food webs. Overall, our approach demonstrates that stoichiometric traits provide a common currency to estimate the dimensionality of stoichiometric niches, and help reduce and rationalize the number of axis required to characterize populations or communities.},

In a previous study we documented the movement behaviour of a specialized goldenrod beetle (Trirhabda borealis Blake) in three kinds of patches: habitat (goldenrod) patches and two types of matrix patch (cut vegetation and cut vegetation containing camouflage netting as an impediment to movement). In the current study, we used this information to construct simulation and experimental landscapes consisting of mosaics of these three patch types, to study the effect of landscape structure on landscape connectivity, using the T. borealis beetle as a model system. In the simulation studies, landscape connectivity was based on movements of individual beetles, and was measured in six different ways. The simulations revealed that the six measures of landscape connectivity were influenced by different aspects of landscape structure, suggesting that: (1) landscape connectivity is a poorly defined concept, and (2) the same landscape may have different landscape connectivity values when different measures of landscape connectivity are used. There were two general predictions that held over all measures of landscape connectivity: (1) increasing interpatch distance significantly decreased landscape connectivity and (2) the influence of matrix elements on landscape connectivity was small in comparison to the influence of habitat elements. Empirical mark-release-resight experiments using Trirhabda beetles in experimental landscapes supported the simulation results.},

  abstract = {In arctic and sub-arctic environments, mercury (Hg), more specifically toxic methylmercury (MeHg), is of growing concern to local communities because of its accumulation in fish. In these regions, there is particular interest in the potential mobilization of atmospherically deposited Hg sequestered in permafrost that is thawing at unprecedented rates. Permafrost thaw and the resulting ground surface subsidence transforms forested peat plateaus into treeless and permafrost-free thermokarst wetlands where inorganic Hg released from the thawed permafrost and draining from the surrounding peat plateaus may be transformed to MeHg. This study begins to characterize the spatial distribution of MeHg in a peat plateau-thermokarst wetland complex, a feature that prevails throughout the wetland-dominated southern margin of thawing discontinuous permafrost in Canada's Northwest Territories. We measured pore water total Hg, MeHg, dissolved organic matter characteristics and general water chemistry parameters to evaluate the role of permafrost thaw on the pattern of water chemistry. A gradient in vegetation composition, water chemistry and dissolved organic matter characteristics followed a toposequence from the ombrotrophic bogs near the crest of the complex to poor fens at its downslope margins. We found that pore waters in poor fens contained elevated levels of MeHg, and the water draining from these features had dissolved MeHg concentrations 4.5 to 14.5 times higher than the water draining from the bogs. It was determined through analysis of historical aerial images that the poor fens in the toposequence had formed relatively recently (early 1970s) as a result of permafrost thaw. Differences between the fens and bogs are likely to be a result of their differences in groundwater function, and this suggests that permafrost thaw in this landscape can result in hotspots for Hg methylation that are hydrologically connected to downstream ecosystems.},

The advice from statisticians for scientists employing multimodel inference is to develop a well-thought-out set of candidate models for comparison, though precise instructions for how to do that are typically not given. A coherent body of knowledge, which falls under the general term causal analysis, now exists for examining the explanatory scientific content of candidate models. Much of the literature on causal analysis has been recently developed, and we suspect may not be familiar to many ecologists. This body of knowledge comprises a set of graphical tools and axiomatic principles to support scientists in their endeavors to create ``well-formed hypotheses,'' as statisticians are asking them to do. Causal analysis is complementary to methods such as structural equation modeling, which provides the means for evaluation of proposed hypotheses against data. In this paper, we summarize and illustrate a set of principles that can guide scientists in their quest to develop explanatory hypotheses for evaluation. The principles presented in this paper have the capacity to close the communication gap between statisticians, who urge scientists to develop well-thought-out coherent models, and scientists, who would like some practical advice for exactly how to do that.},

We qualitatively and quantitatively (where sufficient standardised data were available) assess the literature regarding the role of structural complexity in coral reef ecosystems. A rapidly increasing number of publications have studied the role of complexity in reef ecosystems over the past four decades, with a concomitant increase in the diversity of methods used to quantify structure. Quantitative analyses of existing data indicate a strong negative relationship between structural complexity and algal cover, which may reflect the important role complexity plays in enhancing herbivory by reef fishes. The cover of total live coral and branching coral was positively correlated with structural complexity. These habitat attributes may be creating much of the structure, resulting in a collinear relationship; however, there is also evidence of enhanced coral recovery from disturbances where structural complexity is high. Urchin densities were negatively correlated with structural complexity ; a relationship that may be driven by urchins eroding reef structure or by their gregarious behaviour when in open space. There was a strong positive relationship between structural complexity and fish density and biomass, likely mediated through density-dependent competition and refuge from predation. More variable responses were found when assessing individual fish families , with all families examined displaying a positive relationship to structural complexity, but only half of these relationships were significant. Although only corroborated with qualitative data, structural complexity also seems to have a positive effect on two ecosystem services: tourism and shoreline protection. Clearly, structural complexity is an integral component of coral reef ecosystems, and it should be incorporated into monitoring programs and management objectives.},

Public forest visitors (               n               = 293) were surveyed during the summer of 2015 and asked to choose among images of wildflower communities in which flower species richness, flower abundance, species evenness, color diversity, and presence of charismatic species had been digitally manipulated. Aesthetic preferences among images were unrelated to species richness but increased with more abundant flowers, greater species evenness, and greater color diversity. Aesthetic preferences were consistent across psychographic groups and unaffected by knowledge of local flora or value placed on wildflower viewing. When actual wildflower communities (               n               = 54) were ranked based on empirically measured flower species richness or wildflower viewing utility based on multinomial logit models of revealed preferences, rankings were broadly similar. However, designation of hotspots (CES values above the median) based on species richness alone missed 27\% of wildflower viewing utility hotspots. Thus, conservation priorities for sustaining CES should incorporate social preferences and consider multiple dimensions of biodiversity that underpin CES supply.},

Using bird survey data from the Appalachian Mountains (USA), we developed spatial\textendash temporal models of five CES indicators (total bird species richness, and richness of migratory, infrequent, synanthrope, and resident species), reflecting variation in birdwatcher preferences. We analyzed seasonal shifts in birdwatching supply and how those shifts impacted public access to projected birdwatching hotspots. Landscape patterns of CES supply differed substantially among indicators, leading to opposing conclusions about locations of highest birdwatching supply. Total species richness hotspots seldom overlapped with hotspots of migratory or infrequent species. Public access to CES hotspots varied seasonally. Our study suggests that simple, static biodiversity metrics may overlook spatial dynamics important to CES users.},

Abstract Of several impacts of road salting on roadside soils, the potential disruption of the nitrogen cycle has been largely ignored. Therefore the fates of low-level ammonium-N and nitrate-N inputs to roadside soils impacted by salting over an extended period (decades) in the field have been studied. The use of road salts disrupts the proportional contributions of nitrate-N and ammonium-N to the mineral inorganic fraction of roadside soils. It is highly probable that the degree of salt exposure of the soil, in the longer term, controls the rates of key microbial N transformation processes, primarily by increasing soil pH. Additional influxes of ammonium-N to salt-impacted soils are rapidly nitrified therefore and, there-after, increased leaching of nitrate-N to the local waterways occurs, which has particular relevance to the Water Framework Directive. The results reported are important when assessing the fate of inputs of ammonia to soils from atmospheric pollution.},

  abstract = {Optimal behavior theory suggests that prey animals will reduce activity during intermittent periods when elevated predation risk outweighs the fitness benefits of activity. Specifically, the predation risk allocation hypothesis predicts that prey activity should decrease dramatically at times of high predation risk if there is high temporal variation in predation risk but should remain relatively uniform when temporal variation in predation risk is low. To test these predictions we examined the seasonably variable response of snowshoe hares to moonlight and predation risk. Unlike studies finding uniform avoidance of moonlight in small mammals, we find that moonlight avoidance is seasonal and corresponds to seasonal variation in moonlight intensity. We radiocollared 177 wild snowshoe hares to estimate predation rates as a measure of risk and used movement distances from a sample of those animals as a measure of activity. In the snowy season, 5-day periods around full moons had 2.5 times more predation than around new moons, but that ratio of the increased predation rate was only 1.8 in the snow-free season. There was no significant increase in use of habitats with more hiding cover during full moons. Snowshoe hares' nightly movement distances decreased during high-risk full-moon periods in the snowy season but did not change according to moon phase in the snow-free season.},

  abstract = {Prey responses to predation risk can affect multiple phenotypic traits that have significant implications for population-to-ecosystem-level properties. The general stress paradigm (hereafter GSP) proposes integrating the principles of ecological stoichiometry and prey physiological plasticity in response to predation risk to provide an explicit mechanistic framework to evaluate the direct influence of predation risk on ecosystem functioning. However, theoretical attempts evaluating the GSP have focused on only one component of phenotypic plasticity, neglecting the fact that multiple phenotypic responses can affect nutrient demand and consumption, and therefore, the overall animal effect on nutrient cycling rates and stoichiometry. In this study, we used a dynamic state variable model to examine how variation in predation and starvation risk on a landscape of patch types that vary in food quality affects the behavioural and physiological phenotypic responses of prey and the linked nutrient and carbon recycling. We found that the stress imposed by predation risk promotes prey carbon limitation, which leads to increased nutrient release and carbon uptake due to a stoichiometric mismatch between an animal's demand and food stoichiometry. Such effects can be altered by prey shifting spatially to carbon- or nutrient-rich patches. However, the abilities of prey to cope with new physiological demands can be affected by absolute stress level or the predation risk distribution on a spatially implicit landscape of stoichiometric-divergent patch type availability. Overall, starvation risk can act as a selective force favouring individuals that maximize their growth, thus reducing their nutrient release, but increasing their exposure to predation risk. Our results provide an important connection between predator-induced stress ecology and ecosystem functioning, linking organism nutrition and ecological stoichiometry to fitness outcomes, thus improving our understanding of how non-consumptive predator effects can scale up to ecosystems.},

Samples were collected along this gradient to identify potential factors contributing to the concentrations of total Hg and total organic carbon (TOC) throughout the state. Overall, there is a gradient across the state, with water column concentrations of total Hg (9-53??pM) and TOC (80-2721????M) increasing as one moves from the blue ridge/piedmont region to the coastal floodplain region. Total Hg at all sites in SC is significantly (R2 = 0.78; P {$<$} 0.001) correlated with TOC in the water samples. This correlation explains 78\% of the variance in the data and suggests that mercury is associated with organic matter in water bodies throughout the state. A study of mercury speciation within the coastal plain Waccamaw River indicates that concentrations of total Hg range from 10-68??pM and methyl Hg concentrations range from 1-7??pM. Watershed transport efficiencies for coastal floodplain rivers sampled in this study range from 32-72\% for total Hg and 78-477\% for methyl Hg. The coastal plain sites are located in watersheds that contain a significantly (P {$<$} 0.001) higher percentage of wetlands (16.3 ?? 5\%) than the blue ridge/piedmont region (1.14 ?? 1.6\%), suggesting that drainage through wetlands contributes to the increased concentrations of TOC and total Hg found in SC coastal plain rivers. There is a significant correlation between mean fish Hg concentrations in largemouth bass from each watershed and percent wetland area in each watershed (R2 = 0.66; P = 0.003). This correlation explains 66\% of the variance in the data and suggests that increasing percentages of wetland area contribute to fish Hg concentrations in SC coastal plain rivers. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {It has long been recognised that cities exhibit their own microclimate and are typically warmer than the surrounding rural areas. This `mesoscale' influence is known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect and results largely from modification of surface properties leading to greater absorption of solar radiation, reduced convective cooling and lower water evaporation rates. Cities typically contain less vegetation and bodies of water than rural areas, and existing green and bluespace is often under threat from increasing population densities. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the key ways in which green and bluespace affect both urban canopy- and boundary-layer temperatures, examined from the perspectives of city-planning, urban climatology and climate science. The analysis suggests that the evapotranspiration-based cooling influence of both green and bluespace is primarily relevant for urban canopy-layer conditions, and that tree-dominated greenspace offers the greatest heat stress relief when it is most needed. However, the magnitude and transport of cooling experienced depends on size, spread, and geometry of greenspaces, with some solitary large parks found to offer minimal boundary-layer cooling. Contribution to cooling at the scale of the urban boundary-layer climate is attributed mainly to greenspace increasing surface roughness and thereby improving convection efficiency rather than evaporation. Although bluespace cooling and transport during the day can be substantial, nocturnal warming is highlighted as likely when conditions are most oppressive. However, when both features are employed together they can offer many synergistic ecosystem benefits including cooling. The ways in which green and bluespace infrastructure is applied in future urban growth strategies, particularly in countries expected to experience rapid urbanisation, warrants greater consideration in urban planning policy to mitigate the adverse effects of the UHI and enhance climate resilience.},

Ecological predictive models used for this purpose are constructed using either a mechanistic (process-based) or a phenomenological (empirical) approach, or combination. Given the accelerating pace of global changes, it is becoming increasingly difficult to trust future projections made by phenomenological models estimated under past conditions. Using forest landscape models as an example, I review current modeling approaches and propose principles for developing the next generation of landscape models. First, modelers should increase the use of mechanistic components based on appro- priately scaled ``first principles'' even though such an approach is not without cost and limitations. Second, the interaction of processes within a model should be designed to minimize a priori constraints on process interactions and mimic how interactions play out in real life. Third, when a model is expected to make accurate projections of future system states it must include all of the major ecological processes that structure the system. A completely mechanistic approach to the molecular level is not tractable or desirable at landscape scales. I submit that the best solution is to blend mechanistic and phenomenolog- ical approaches in a way that maximizes the use of mechanisms where novel driver conditions are expected while keeping the model tractable. There may be other ways. I challenge landscape ecosystem modelers to seek new ways to make their models more robust to the multiple global changes occurring today},

The results indicate that most UES studies have been undertaken in Europe, North America, and China, at city scale. Assessment methods involve biophysical models, Geographical Information Systems, and valuation, but few study findings have been implemented as land use policy.},

  abstract = {Despite the voluminous literature documenting plant-animal interactions, it is only recently that ecologists have begun to focus upon the importance of seedling herbivory in plant communities. This review aims to synthesize our current understanding of the effect that selective seedling removal by herbivores has in shaping post-disturbance plant community structure. In order to do this I describe how individual seedling and plant community characteristics influence the likelihood of seedling herbivory. I argue that seedling palatability, size and morphology, together with the frequency, distribution and timing of seedling emergence all play a significant role in determining seedling regeneration success in the face of herbivore attack. I also outline how current plant defence theories can be related to recent field observations concerning seedling acceptability and removal. In addition, I suggest that those seedling characteristics which provide the emerging plant with some degree of resistance against herbivory should be viewed as one component of a suite of plant life history traits affecting seedling regeneration success or failure. In view of the increasing importance of comparative methods in plant ecology, I propose that future research should integrate seedling acceptability with other plant life history traits thought to affect seedling regeneration. Recent work suggests that seed size may be paramount in determining regeneration success. I explore the possibility that seed size and seedling acceptability may be linked and discuss how these two factors may interact along successional gradients in plant communities.},

We developed a novel process that combined stakeholder analysis, a survey, and a workshop to generate information about discrepancies between desired and provided ecosystem services, and facilitate community-based development of ideas for actions to reduce these discrepancies. We applied this process in a region of Quebec, Canada, where our results show how community members benefit from numerous ecosystem services on diverse property types, but they benefit unequally. Using our process, community members developed ideas for actions to reduce most identified discrepancies. Actions centered around the following themes: developing infrastructure; controlling access; gaining status; encouraging involvement; adjusting natural infrastructure; increasing services; and, information transmission. Findings related to our process also emerged: different knowledge types complement each other to create a broader picture of how people benefit from nature; assessing satisfaction helps uncover nuances associated with discrepancies; knowledge co-creation helps develop ideas for actions to reduce discrepancies; and, considering different perspectives can help avoid trade-offs.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

  abstract = {Climate change brings with it unprecedented rates of increase in environmental tem-perature, which will have major consequences for the earth's flora and fauna. The Odonata represent a taxon that has many strong links to this abiotic factor due to its tropical evolutionary history and adaptations to temperate climates. Tempera-ture is known to affect odonate physiology including life-history traits such as de-velopmental rate, phenology and seasonal regulation as well as immune function and the production of pigment for thermoregulation. A range of behaviours are likely to be affected which will, in turn, influence other parts of the aquatic ecosystem, pri-marily through trophic interactions. Temperature may influence changes in geo-graphical distributions, through a shifting of species' fundamental niches, changes in the distribution of suitable habitat and variation in the dispersal ability of species. Finally, such a rapid change in the environment results in a strong selective pressure towards adaptation to cope and the inevitable loss of some populations and, poten-tially, species. Where data are lacking for odonates, studies on other invertebrate groups will be considered. Finally, directions for research are suggested, particularly laboratory studies that investigate underlying causes of climate-driven macroeco-logical patterns.},

Similarly, a great deal of biodiversity persists in urban environments where synanthropic communities are supplemented by species that thrive in disturbed environments. Aquatic urban biodiversity appears to persist despite anthropogenic stressors: an array of anthropogenic pollutants (road salt and heavy metals), invasive species, and active mismanagement\textemdash particularly the removal of riparian vegetation. Optimizing urban ponds for different ecosystem services results in conflicting priorities over hydrological, geochemical, ecological, aesthetic, and cultural functions. The socio-ecosystem approach to environmental management opens a path to greater incorporation of biodiversity into town planning and sustainability, while accounting for cultural attitudes to urban ecosystems. I identify a range of research needs: (1) the roles of design and location of urban ponds in influencing biodiversity, (2) the function of urban wetlands for stormwater and pollution management, and (3) public perceptions of urban ecosystems and how those perceptions are influenced by interactions with natural systems. Urban wetlands offer an important opportunity to educate the general public on natural systems and science in general using a resource that is located on their doorstep. In the face of increasing pressures on natural systems and increasing extent and intensity of urbanization, a more comprehensive appreciation of the challenges and opportunities provided by urban ponds could play a substantial role in driving sustainable urban development.},

However , more data does not necessarily yield greater knowledge in understanding animal ecology and conservation. In this paper, we provide a review of the major benefits, problems and potential misuses of GPS/Argos technology to animal ecology and conservation. Benefits are obvious, and include the ability to collect fine-scale spatio-temporal location data on many previously impossible to study animals, such as ocean-going fish, migratory songbirds and long-distance migratory mammals. These benefits come with significant problems, however, imposed by frequent collar failures and high cost, which often results in weaker study design, reduced sample sizes and poorer statistical inference. In addition, we see the divorcing of biologists from a field-based understanding of animal ecology to be a growing problem. Despite these difficulties, GPS devices have provided significant benefits, particularly in the conservation and ecology of wide-ranging species. We conclude by offering suggestions for ecologists on which kinds of ecological questions would currently benefit the most from GPS/Argos technology, and where the technology has been potentially misused. Significant conceptual challenges remain, however, including the links between movement and behaviour, and movement and population dynamics.},

For example, woodland caribou prefer coniferous forests to avoid predation at the coarse-scale and at finer scales select for forage within forests. Forestry reduces the benefits of forests and prevents the regeneration of adequate caribou habitat. We described Newfoundland woodland car-ibou habitat preferences across coarse and fine spatial scales and assessed whether cutovers regenerate into forests of similar value to those preferred by the caribou. We determined if caribou preferred coniferous forests at the coarse-scale and which stand characteristics were selected within coniferous stands at the fine-scale. Linear regression was used to determine which stand characteristics predicted the intensity of use of the coniferous forests by the caribou. The same stand characteristics were used to compare cutovers of various ages to coniferous forests using principal component analyses to determine if they share similar characteristics. We found at the coarse-scale that coniferous forests were most preferred but did not differ from cutovers, and at the fine-scale caribou used coniferous forests with more forage. Cutovers did not develop into forests with similar stand characteristics as the coniferous forests selected by the caribou; the canopy of the cutovers was more closed and supported less forage than the coniferous forests. Old cutovers ({$>$}40 years) foster less forage for caribou and may act as a refuge from predation. This may cause caribou to seek forage in more risky landscapes in order to meet dietary requirements.},

  abstract = {Contemporary landscapes are subject to a multitude of human-derived stressors. Effects of such stressors are increasingly realized by population declines and large-scale extirpation of taxa worldwide. Most notably, cumulative effects of climate and landscape change can limit species' local adaptation and dispersal capabilities, thereby reducing realized niche space and range extent. Resolving the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on species persistence is a pressing challenge in ecology, especially for declining species. For example, wolverines (Gulo gulo L.) persist on only 40\% of their historic North American range. While climate change has been shown to be a mechanism of range retractions, anthropogenic landscape disturbance has been recently implicated. We hypothesized these two interact to effect declines. We surveyed wolverine occurrence using camera trapping and genetic tagging at 104 sites at the wolverine range edge, spanning a 15,000 km2 gradient of climate, topographic, anthropogenic, and biotic variables. We used occupancy and generalized linear models to disentangle the factors explaining wolverine distribution. Persistent spring snow pack\textemdash expected to decrease with climate change\textemdash was a significant predictor, but so was anthropogenic landscape change. Canid mesocarnivores, which we hypothesize are competitors supported by anthropogenic landscape change, had comparatively weaker effect. Wolverine population declines and range shifts likely result from climate change and landscape change operating in tandem. We contend that similar results are likely for many species and that research that simultaneously examines climate change, landscape change, and the biotic landscape is warranted. Ecology research and species conservation plans that address these interactions are more likely to meet their objectives.},

We measured wood nutrient concentrations in 106 tree species in 10 forest plots spanning a regional fertility gradient in Panama. For a subset of species, we quantified foliar nutrients and wood density to test whether wood nutrients scale with foliar nutrients at the species level, or wood nutrient storage increases with wood density as predicted by the wood economics spectrum. Wood nutrient concentrations varied enormously among species from fourfold in nitrogen (N) to {$>$} 30-fold in calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and phosphorus (P). Community-weighted mean wood nutrient concentrations correlated positively with soil Ca, K, Mg and P concentrations. Wood nutrients scaled positively with leaf nutrients, supporting the hypothesis that nutrient allocation is conserved across plant organs. Wood P was most sensitive to variation in soil nutrient availability, and significant radial declines in wood P indicated that tropical trees retranslocate P as sapwood transitions to heartwood. Wood P decreased with increasing wood density, suggesting that low wood P and dense wood are traits associated with tree species persistence on low fertility soils. Substantial variation among species and communities in wood nutrient concentrations suggests that allocation of nutrients to wood, especially P, influences species distributions and nutrient dynamics in tropical forests.},

  abstract = {Although both food availability and predation risk have been hypothesized to affect dolphin habitat use and group size, no study has measured both factors concurrently to determine their relative influences. From 1997 to 1999, we investigated the effect of food availability and tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) predation risk on bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) habitat use and group size in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Food availability was measured by fish trapping, while predation risk was assessed by shark catch rates, acoustic tracks, and Crittercam deployments. Dolphin habitat use was determined using belt transects. The biomass of dolphin prey did not vary seasonally and was significantly greater in shallow habitats than in deeper ones. Tiger sharks were virtually absent during cold months of 1997 and 1998, abundant in warm months of all years, and found at an intermediate density during cold months of 1999. When present, shark density was highest in shallow habitats. Decreased echolocation efficiency in very shallow water and poor visual detection of tiger sharks (camouflaged over seagrass) probably further enhance the riskiness of such habitats, and the relative riskiness of shallow habitats is supported by the observation that dolphins select deep waters in which to rest. The observed dolphin group sizes were consistent with a food-safety trade-off. Groups were larger in more dangerous shallow habitats and larger during resting than during foraging. Foraging dolphins matched the distribution of their food when sharks were absent. However, during warm months, the distribution of foraging dolphins significantly deviated from that of their food, with fewer dolphins foraging in the productive (but dangerous) shallow habitats than expected on the basis of food alone. When shark density was intermediate, habitat use by foraging dolphins was more similar to the high-shark-density seasons than periods of low shark density. These results suggest that foraging dolphin distributions reflect a trade-off between predation risk and food availability. Because the distribution and abundance of tiger sharks are influenced by species other than dolphins, the distribution of the tiger sharks' primary prey may indirectly influence dolphin habitat use, suggesting that it is important to consider the community context in studies of habitat use.},

Playas are also highly threatened from anthropogenic land use (chiefly agriculture, which decreases hydroperiod through increased sedimentation). We examined community structure of adult odonates (dragonflies and damselflies) in playas differing in the 2 main regional forms of surrounding land use (cropland vs. grassland). Analysis of odonate diversity revealed high overlap between cropland and grassland playas. Traditional species-area theory did not fit observed patterns, as there appears to be a threshold playa size that supports maximal odonate diversity; this nonlinear response may reflect a tradeoff between hydroperiod and availability of emergent vegetation that is required for perching and oviposition. Since agriculture effectively reduces playa depth but not size of the overall playa watershed, this may mean that cropland playas serve as "ecological traps." This property has important implications for regional odonate diversity.},

Specifically, marsh sites experiencing trace or greater vertical oiling of plant tissues displayed reductions in cover and peak standing crop relative to reference (no oiling), particularly in the marsh edge zone, for the majority of this four year study. Similarly, elevated chlorosis of plant tissue, as estimated by a vegetation health index, was detected for marsh sites with trace or greater vertical oiling in the first two years of the study. Key environmental factors, such as hydrologic regime, elevation, and soil characteristics, were generally similar across plant oiling classes (including reference), indicating that the observed injury to plant production and health was the result of plant oiling and not potential differences in environmental setting. Although fewer significant impacts to plant production and health were detected in the latter years of the study, this is due in part to decreased sample size occurring as a result of erosion (shoreline retreat) and resultant loss of plots, and should not be misconstrued as indicating full recovery of the ecosystem.},

Ponds are common features in the urban landscape and have been created for a variety of reasons ranging from ornamental/amenity purposes through to the detention of urban runoff and pollution. This paper aims to quantify the aquatic macroinvertebrate biodi-versity associated with garden, ornamental and other urban ponds in Leicestershire, UK. We examined the macroinvertebrate biodiversity of 41 urban ponds (13 garden, 12 park and 16 other urban ponds) within the town of Loughborough, UK. Park ponds supported greater macroinvertebrate richness than garden or other urban ponds. Garden ponds were the most taxon poor. Pond size was strongly correlated with macroinverte-brate diversity. Collectively, urban ponds were found to be physically and biologically heterogeneous and were characterised by high community dissimilarity. Urban ponds provide a diverse range of habitats for a mixture of common and rare aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa and represent a valuable biodiversity resource within an-thropogenically dominated landscapes. Recognition of the significant contribution of ponds to urban freshwater biodiversity is important for future aquatic conservation within anthropogenically dominated landscapes.},

  abstract = {Urbanization is a global process contributing to the loss and fragmentation of natural habitats. Many studies have focused on the biological response of terrestrial taxa and habitats to urbanization. However, little is known regarding the consequences of urbanization on freshwater habitats, especially small lentic systems. In this study we examined aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity (family and species level) and variation in community composition between 240 urban and 784 non-urban ponds distributed across the UK. Contrary to predictions, urban ponds supported similar numbers of invertebrate species and families compared to non-urban ponds. Similar gamma diversity was found between the two groups at a family level, and while at a species level gamma diversity was higher in non-urban ponds, this difference was not statistically significant. The biological communities of urban ponds were markedly different to those of non-urban ponds and the variability in urban pond community composition was greater than that in non-urban ponds, contrary to previous work showing homogenisation of communities in urban areas. Positive spatial autocorrelation was recorded for urban and non-urban ponds at 0-50 km (distance between pond study sites) and negative spatial autocorrelation was observed at 100-150 km, and was stronger in urban ponds in both cases. Ponds do not follow the same ecological patterns as terrestrial and lotic habitats (reduced taxonomic richness) in urban environments; in contrast they support high taxonomic richness and contribute significantly to regional faunal diversity. Individual cities are complex structural mosaics which evolve over long periods of time and are managed in diverse ways, promoting the development of a wide-range of environmental conditions and habitat niches in urban ponds which can promote greater heterogeneity between pond communities at larger scales. Ponds provide an opportunity for managers and environmental regulators to conserve and enhance freshwater biodiversity in urbanized landscapes whilst also facilitating key ecosystem services including storm water storage and water treatment.},

We experimentally tested this theory using pelagic metacommunities. We amended existing predictions by explicitly considering evenness as an aspect of biodiversity and including control of algal biomass by consumption in addition to competition. The metacommunities received a different phosphorus (P) supply and the three patches within each metacommunity differed in their nitrogen (N) supply, which created different N : P ratios (2, 16, and 128). All patches were inoculated with a phyto-plankton assemblage consisting of five species, and half of the meta-communities received two ciliate species as consumers. At the level of the entire metacommunity, algal biomass increased with increasing P supply, whereas species richness and evenness decreased with increasing P supply. Without consumers, resource use efficiency (RUE; realized biomass per unit of P) increased with increasing richness and evenness. Consumer presence reduced overall biomass and richness and precluded a correlation between RUE and biodiversity. At the patch level, local evenness correlated with higher RUE at both imbalanced N : P ratios (2 and 128) but not at a balanced N : P ratio. In conclusion, overall P supply constrained realized biomass and altered diversity, whereas resource stoichiometry shaped the relationship between biodiversity and RUE.},

  abstract = {Prey animals use different strategies to avoid detection by predators and to flee once detected. Key issues are what aspects of movement prey change in response to predation risk and how differences in habitat affect escape movements. We answer these questions for snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) in Montana, using an experimental manipulation and habitats for which annual mortality rates varied more than fourfold. We examine a) whether the mortality risk of a habitat affects movement tortuosity and speed of foraging snowshoe hares and b) whether tortuosity and speed of hares fleeing from a predator (a leashed dog, Canis familiaris) differ among these forest stands. Snowshoe hares did not differ in tortuosity or speed while foraging in these stands, suggesting that other anti-predator behaviours were used. Hares fleeing from the leashed dog showed much faster and straighter movements than foraging hares, but escape trajectories were similar in all forest stands, suggesting a relatively inflexible response while fleeing. Varying tortuosity and speed are clearly part of the snowshoe hare's behavioural repertoire for escaping predation, but these attributes of movement were insensitive to the annual mortality rates in each forest stand.},

  abstract = {Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) undergo a 10-year population cycle with several years of low densities. Several authors have suggested that snowshoe hares modify their foraging behaviour to reduce predation risk during the low phase, resulting in protein-poor diets and poor body condition. We test that idea by using a factorial manipulation of food supplementation and predator reduction and by examining the species composition, browse size, and nutritional quality of snowshoe hare diets during 3 years of low snowshoe hare abundance in southwestern Yukon. Our results negate the hypothesis that snowshoe hares change their diets in response to mammalian predators during the cyclic low phase. Snowshoe hares on the different treatments had diets that differed in species composition and twig sizes, but protected hares did not have higher protein diets than unprotected hares. Snowshoe hares with access to supplemental food ate more fibrous and lower protein natural browse than unfed hares, showing that they did not choose diets primarily for protein content. Instead, snowshoe hares converted a wide range of forage availabilities into similar intakes of protein and fibre, despite variation in predator presence. Our results suggest that snowshoe hares select their diets to balance the protein and fibre contents. Although sublethal effects of predators may influence cyclic dynamics, our results show that such a feedback does not occur via a nutritional mechanism, counter to previous suggestions.},

We examined whether hares change their foraging movements and browse site selection in response to manipulations of food addition and predator reduction during a cyclic low phase. Snowshoe hares on sites with supplemental rabbit chow ate fewer species per site and preferred to browse in slightly denser cover than unfed hares. Differences in foraging behaviour were linked to season and site characteristics. Snowshoe hares moved similar distances and spent similar amounts of time per browse site in the presence and absence of terrestrial predators. Hares protected from predators used slightly more browse sites in thick cover, but this pattern was partially due to differences in availability. The absence of terrestrial predators had little effect on snowshoe hare foraging behaviour; instead, browse distribution patterns explained most of the behavioural variation. Thus, the predicted patterns in response to the manipulations did not occur, and our results challenge the idea that changes in snowshoe hare foraging behaviour contribute to their cyclic dynamics.},

We use text analysis and machine learning to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations? Are underrepre-sented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations? And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and discounted: For example, novel contributions by gender and racial minorities are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that discounts diversity's role in innovation and partly explains the underrepresentation of some groups in academia. diversity | innovation | science | inequality | sociology of science},

MeHg water column concentration in each of the four wetlands was positively correlated with MeHg concentrations present in surface sediment and pore water, and with the calculated sediment-water MeHg flux rate. In addition to MeHg, ethylmercury (EtHg) was detected in the sediment in all four wetlands, but not in the pore water or the water column. EtHg levels in sediment exceeded MeHg concentrations in two of the wetlands. This demonstrates that Hg ethylation is a significant part of the Hg cycle in some aquatic environments. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition\textemdash two processes important in all ecosystems\textemdash are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. In experi-ments, intermediate levels of species loss (21\textendash 40\%) reduced plant production by 5\textendash 10\%, comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41\textendash 60\%) had effects rivalling those of ozone, acidification, elevated CO 2 and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels, species loss generally had equal or greater effects on de-composition than did elevated CO 2 and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in pro-ductivity and decomposition, generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global change stressors that have mobilized major inter-national concern and remediation efforts 9 . A variety of global changes are driving rates of species extinction that greatly outpace background rates in the fossil record 10,11 . If these trends continue, projections suggest that within 240 years Earth may face the sixth mass extinction 12 . Such projections have prompted hundreds of experiments examining how different components of biodiversity affect ecosystem processes that sustain the provisioning of goods and services to society. Syntheses of these experiments have made it clear that plant biodiversity loss will reduce plant production and alter decomposition 5,6 . However, it is uncertain how the sizes of these effects compare with the direct effects of other types of envir-onmental change, such as changing atmospheric composition, climate warming and nutrient pollution, that also threaten ecosystem func-tioning 13\textendash 15 . This uncertainty has generated wide-ranging speculation about how strongly biodiversity loss might affect humanity 16,17 . Here we report the results of a large data synthesis in which we compared the effects of species loss against other drivers of envir-onmental change.

  abstract = {In this perspective, we argue that creating the positive outcomes socio-ecological researchers and practitioners seek for urban areas requires acknowledging and addressing the interactions of race and systemic racism in parks, open and green spaces. Racial experiences are inseparable from physical landscapes and the processes of designing, managing, or studying them. From COVID-19 to the Black Lives Matter movement and protests, the events of 2020 in the United States underscore how considerations of social justice must extend beyond the conventional distributional focus of environmental justice. It must incorporate an understanding of how the built environment is racialized spatially, but not always readily quantified through the proximity-based measurements frequently used in research and practice. The perspective is organized in three main parts. The first part presents a series of vignettes to frame the ways cities and individuals participate, respond, and interact under COVID-19 with racial segregation as the backdrop. The second part suggests a stepwise approach to building an understanding of racial inequities in socio-ecological systems (SES) research and practice including four entry points: (1) racialized spatial distribution of hazards and amenities, (2) racialized qualities of space, (3) racialized people in space, and (4) racialized creation of space. Finally, the third part proposes actions the SES community can take to enhance our commitment to community recovery, improvement, and thrivability. This perspective cautions practitioners and researchers against opportunistic or quick-fix solutions, and instead challenges our colleagues to be inclusive of disenfranchised voices in shaping socio-ecological goals, now more than ever. The goal of this perspective is to spark engagement with power and privilege in parks and open space using the example of COVID-19 and race in the US.},

Comparing disease dynamics between introduced and endemic regions can offer insight into which naive hosts will persist or go extinct, with disease acting as a filter on host communities. We examined four hypothesized mechanisms for host \textendash{} pathogen persistence by comparing host infection patterns and environmental reservoirs for Pseudogymnoascus destructans (the causative agent of white-nose syndrome) in Asia, an endemic region, and North Amer- ica, where the pathogen has recently invaded. Although colony sizes of bats and hibernacula temperatures were very similar, both infection prevalence and fungal loads were much lower on bats and in the environment in Asia than North America. These results indicate that transmission intensity and pathogen growth are lower in Asia, likely due to higher host resistance to pathogen growth in this endemic region, and not due to host tolerance, lower transmission due to smaller populations, or lower environmentally driven pathogen growth rate. Disease filtering also appears to be favouring initially resistant species in North America. More broadly, determining the mechanisms allowing species persistence in endemic regions can help ident- ify species at greater risk of extinction in introduced regions, and determine the consequences for disease dynamics and host\textendash pathogen coevolution.},

  abstract = {spatial variations in soil nitrogen and phosphorus supply rates in a boreal aspen forest. Can. J. Soil Sci. 77: 597-612. Soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supply is one of the growth limiting factors in many forest ecosystems. Seasonal patterns in soil N and P supply rate were examined during a 2-yr period (1994-1995) for forest floor (L, F and H) and upper mineral (Ae) horizons in an 80-yr-old aspen forest in Saskatchewan, Canada. Accumulation of plant nutrient ions on ion exchange resins incubated in the field can provide an estimate of nutrient supply rate in soils because ion exchange resins have the potential ability to simulate nutrient flux to plant roots. Nutrient supply rates and the effect of plant uptake on nutrient supply rate was assessed using ion exchange membranes buried inside and outside polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cylinders. The difference between ion flux to the membranes inside (root uptake excluded) versus outside the cylinders was used as an index of plant nutrient uptake. From May to October, nutrient uptake (\textmu g 10 cm-2 2 wk-1) by plants ranged from 1.6 to 31.7 (NO 3-N), from 2.7 to 13.7 (NH 4 +-N) and from 2.6 to 12.7 (P), with maximum N and P uptake in summer. Nutrient uptake by plants also varied among horizons. In general, plant uptake of NO 3-N, NH 4 +-N and P was highest in the H horizon, followed by the F and Ae horizons, with lowest uptake apparent in the L horizon. The results are consistent with the distribution of plant fine roots: most were found in the H horizon (68\%), followed by the Ae and F horizons (15\%), and the L (2\%) horizon. Autumn litterfall represented a nutrient return of 28-40 kg N ha-1 and 4-7 kg P ha-1 to the forest floor which coincided with an increase in ion supply rates in the forest floor. During the growing season, atmospheric inputs via bulk deposition and throughfall contributed small amounts of N (1.8 kg NH 4 +-N ha-1 and 0.23 kg NO 3-N ha-1) and P (1.38 kg ha-1 inorganic P) to the forest floor. Recycling of nutrients by litterfall and subsequent mineralization and re-assimilation by plant roots in the forest floor is a dynamic and important component of nutrient cycling in boreal aspen forest ecosystems.

La disponibilit\'e de l'azote (N) et du phosphore (P) du sol est l'un des facteurs qui limitent la croissance dans de nombreux \'ecosyst\`emes forestiers. Nous avons examin\'e, sur une p\'eriode de deux ans, l'allure saisonni\`ere des taux d'approvisionnement de N et de P du sol dans la couche organique (horizons L, F et H) et dans les horizons min\'eraux sup\'erieurs (Ae) d'une tremblaie de 80 ans, situ\'ee en Saskatchewan au Canada. L'accumulation des nutriments v\'eg\'etaux sur des r\'esines \'echangeuses d'ions mises \`a incuber sur le terrain peut fournir une estimation du taux de disponibilit\'e des nutriments dans les sols, du fait de l'aptitude des r\'esines \`a simuler le flux des nutriments vers les racines. Les taux de disponibilit\'e des nutriments et l'effet de l'exportation par les plantes sur ces taux sont \'evalu\'es au moyen de membranes d'\'echange ionique enterr\'ees \`a l'int\'erieur et \`a l'ext\'erieur de cyclindres en PVC. La diff\'erence entre le flux des ions vers les membranes int\'erieures (\`a l'exception de l'absorption racinaire) et le flux vers les membranes ext\'erieures est utilis\'ee comme index de l'absorption des nutriments par la plante. De mai \`a octobre, l'absorption de nutriments par les plantes, en \textmu g 10 cm-2 par 2 semaines, s'\'etendait de 1,6 \`a 31,7 (N-NO 3-), de 2,7 \`a 13,7 (N-NH 4 +) et de 2,6 \`a 12,7 (P), la plus forte exportation de N et de P survenant en \'et\'e. L'absorption fluctuait \'egale-ment entre les horizons. En g\'en\'eral, celle des trois nutriments \'etait \`a son niveau le plus haut dans l'horizon H, suivie des horizons F et Ae et en dernier de l'horizon L. Ces observations concordent avec la r\'epartition des radicelles dans le sol, dont la plupart (68\%) se trouvaient dans l'horizon H, 15\% chacun dans les horizons Ae et F et enfin 2\% dans l'horizon L. Les retomb\'ees de liti\`ere en automne consistaient en une restitution \`a la couche organique de 28 \`a 40 kg N et de 4 \`a 7 kg P par hectare, ce qui co\"incidait avec un accroisse-ment des taux d'approvisionnement ionique dans cette m\^eme couche. Durant la saison de v\'eg\'etation, les d\'ep\^ots atmosph\'eriques directs ou \`a les pluviolessivats apportaient de petites quantit\'es de N (1,8 kg N-NH 4 + , 0,23 kg N-NO 3-et de P (1,38 kg P min\'eral) par hectare \`a la couche organique du sol. Le recyclage des nutriments par la liti\`ere et leur min\'eralisation et leur r\'eassimilation subs\'equentes par les racines constituent une composante importante du cycle des nutriments dans l'\'ecosyst\`eme de la tremblaie bor\'eale. Mots cl\'es: Couche organique du sol forestier, membrane d'\'echange ionique, disponibilit\'e des nutriments The supply of plant available nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in forest soils, especially in the forest floor, can vary greatly with depth and season. The forest floor is important to forest biogeochemical cycles and is essential for stand nutrition (Raulund-Rasmussen and Vejre 1995). Nutrients, largely in organic form, are returned to the forest floor as lit-terfall and converted into plant-available forms primarily through mineralization. Most mineralization and nitrifica-tion studies in forests have focused on the forest floor and the upper mineral soil (e.g., Boone 1992; Tietema et al. 1992, 1993).

We found that the number of Chinese bitterling eaten by alien crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) decreased with the increasing structural complexity and increased with prey density. Similar reductions in predation rate with increased habitat complexity occurred at all three different prey densities. Our study indicates that structural complexity can decrease the crayfish predation on freshwater fishes.},

  abstract = {Planning for safe passage of wildlife involves understanding the complexities of natural and human landscapes and incorporating connectivity assessments in local and regional planning. The present study describes a novel landscape analysis approach that was used in the context of municipal open space planning and regional land use and transportation planning. The project approach focused on two principles: (1) wildlife movement is not limited to formally managed reserves and corridors, but occurs across a gradient of land uses in the human landscape, and (2) that local and regional planners should be included in the process of identifying habitat connectivity needs and in turn incorporate connectivity in their own planning processes. In the first case, a species-specific combination of landscape disturbance and least-cost modeling was based on the concept that wildlife originate their movement from anywhere within suitable habitat and move in a least-costly direction. This results in a "least cost surface" of possible wildlife movement based on habitat preference and barriers to safe passage. In the second case, planners at two geographic scales - municipal and regional - were informed of landscape connectivity principles and their needs incorporated into the assessment itself. The least cost surface approach allows for the integration of modeled connectivity and disturbance with site-specific municipal planning activities. However, the potential for this type of local planning to be folded into local decision-making processes can be dependent on the interests of individual planners rather than being systematic in nature. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Hibernating bats have undergone severe recent declines across the eastern United States, but the cause of these regional-scale declines has not been systematically evaluated. We assessed the influence of white-nose syndrome (an emerging bat disease caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, formerly Geomyces destructans) on large-scale, long-term population patterns in the little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus), the northern myotis (Myotis septentrionalis), and the tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus). We modeled population trajectories for each species, on the basis of an extensive dataset of winter hibernacula counts of more than one million individual bats from a four-state region over a 13-year time period, in combination with data on locations of hibernacula and first detections of white-nose syndrome at each hibernaculum. We used generalized additive mixed models to determine population change relative to expectations, namely how population trajectories differed with a colony's infection status, how trajectories differed with distance from the point-of-introduction of white-nose syndrome, and whether declines were concordant with first local observation of the disease. Our results indicated that population trajectories in all species met at least one of the three expectations, but none met all three. Our results suggest, therefore, that white-nose syndrome has affected regional populations differently than previously understood, and not as the sole cause of declines. Specifically, our results suggest that in some areas and species, threats other than white-nose syndrome are also contributing to population declines, declines linked to white-nose syndrome have spread across large geographic areas with unexpected speed, and the disease or other threats led to declines in bat populations for years prior to disease detection. Effective conservation will require further research to mitigate impacts of white-nose syndrome, renewed attention to other threats to bats, and improved surveillance efforts to ensure early detection of white-nose syndrome.

Small green areas, including school green areas (SGAs), are an important component of urban green infrastructure, playing a key role in supplying cities with educational services. This article describes how SGAs can amplify an urban green area's connectivity and multifunctionality. The analysis was performed in Bucharest as a case study. A survey based on questionnaires was used to obtain data regarding green spaces within public schools. A total of 411 administrators from 461 public schools participated in the survey for a response rate of 89.1\%. Information from the questionnaires was augmented with spatial data of SGAs and public green spaces, i.e., parks and city gardens. Using parametric and nonparametric statistical analysis, we first identified the variables that determine an SGA's presence and size. Potential connectivity assessment results showed that most of the schools that lack or have small-sized SGAs have the possibility to cover their green space deficit by developing activities within nearby public green spaces. A structural connectivity assessment of SGAs toward other public urban green areas revealed that SGAs are an important element of the urban environment by serving as stepping stones to species flow. The multifunctionality of the SGAs was emphasized through the educational services they provide, being involved in pupils' daily activities. The increased connectivity and multifunctionality of urban green infrastructure through small, specialized green areas, such as SGAs, is an indicator of the fact that such areas can be used to ameliorate the deficit of green space in major urban areas.},

In \v{S}kocjan Inlet Nature Reserve it was carefully planned for new mudflats and islets to be created along a microaltitudinal gradient, aiming to achieve the spontaneous development of at least three target habitat types (mudflats not covered by seawater at low tide, Mediterranean glasswort swards and Mediterranean saltmarsh scrubs, including the transitional forms between them) through the primary succession pathways. Thus, this study was actually projected as a field experiment, on the one hand, and as a practical conservation measure, to recover a degraded area, on another. Vegetation cover on the newly constructed mudflats changed by 92\% over 6 years of succession. In general, un-vegetated mudflats decreased from 71\% to 26\%. In contrast to this, Mediterranean glasswort swards increased from 6.5\% to 28.2\%, whereas saltmarsh scrub had the longest positive trend, constantly gaining area from 2008 (0.6\%) to 2012 (28.9\%). Detailed mapping showed rather deterministic successional pathways, which make restoration plans for halophyte communities more predictable. The study shows that this "ecological experiment" might have concrete implications for the restoration or re-creation of halophyte plant communities along sedimentary seacoasts-in general, all priority habitats in the European Union. The approach of creating artificial terrain within coastal protected areas is especially important in the light of the climate change-driven rise in sea level, often in conjunction with the "coastal squeeze" phenomenon.},

The impacts include habitat fragmentation and changes to both the quality and quantity of the stormwater runoff, and result in changes to hydrological systems. This review integrates research in relatively diverse areas to examine how the impacts of urban imperviousness on hydrological systems can be quantified and modelled. It examines the nature of reported impacts of urbanisation on hydrological systems over four decades, including the effects of changes in imperviousness within catchments, and some inconsistencies in studies of the impacts of urbanisation. The distribution of imperviousness within urban areas is important in understanding the impacts of urbanisation and quantification requires detailed charac-terisation of urban areas. As a result most mapping of urban areas uses remote sensing techniques and this review examines a range of techniques using medium and high resolution imagery, including spectral unmixing. The third section examines the ways in which scientists and hydrological and envi-ronmental engineers model and quantify water flows in urban areas, the nature of hydrological models and methods for their calibration.

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Conservation of soil and water resources is one of the key criteria underpinning sustainable forest man-agement. While soil and water resources are important determinants of forest productivity, without appropriate assessment of soil erosion risk and the application of best management practices (BMPs), some forest management activities can adversely affect hillslope erosion rates with detrimental conse-quences for aquatic environments and downstream water users. In the multiple-use native eucalypt for-ests of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, hazard matrix tables are currently used to identify soil erosion risk based upon rainfall erosivity, soil regolith stability and slope classes at the compartment scale prior to undertaking forestry activities. Resultant ''inherent hazard levels'' (IHLs) direct the BMPs to be used, such as riparian buffer widths, during harvesting and roading operations. The IHL model, being an ordinal classification system, only provides a relative indication of erosion potential without any quantitative estimate of possible post-harvest erosion rates. To potentially better identify erosion risk and quantify likely soil erosion under a range of forest management and climatic scenarios at the hillslope and/or catchment scale, in this paper we utilised an alternative approach by modelling soil erosion using the empirically-derived Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation in combination with a GIS-based spatially dis-tributed raster analysis. In four case study catchments in Kangaroo River State forest, two of which were subjected to single-tree selection harvesting operations, mean annual changes in soil loss were estimated at a grid cell level. Potential differences in soil loss estimates were assessed before, during and after selec-tive logging. Vegetation cover and soil samples were recorded in a 500 \^A 1000 m rectangular network laid out across the catchments. Slope gradient was found to contribute substantially to the spatial vari-ability of soil loss estimation across the catchments. However, between-year differences demonstrate that the highest estimated annual rates of soil loss occurred on steep hillslopes when high levels of rain-fall were recorded, while the values on those same areas remained considerably lower during low rainfall periods. The major effect of the rainfall component in generating soil erosion overshadows the modest impacts of selective logging operations.},

In addition to PAHs derived from industrial activity (i.e., oil sands mining) within the Athabasca watershed, however, forest fires and erosion of fossil fuel deposits within both the Athabasca and Peace watersheds are two potentially important natural sources of PAHs delivered to the PAD. Consequently, evaluating the environmental impact of mining activities requires a quantitative understanding of natural, background PAHs. Here, we utilize molecular-level natural-abundance radiocarbon measurements on an amalgamated sediment record from a Peace River flood-susceptible oxbow lake in the northern Peace sector of the PAD to quantitatively discriminate sources of naturally occurring alkylated PAHs (fossil and modern biomass). A radiocarbon mass balance quantified a predominantly natural petrogenic source (93\% petrogenic, 7\% forest fire) for alkylated PAHs during the past {$\sim$}50 years. Additionally, a significant petrogenic component determined for retene, a compound usually considered a biomarker for softwood combustion, suggests that its use as a unique forest fire indicator may not be suitable in PAD sediments receiving Peace watershed-derived fluvial inputs.},

  abstract = {Understanding the ecological consequences of evolutionary change is a central challenge in contemporary biology. We propose a framework based on the \textasciitilde 25 elements represented in biology, which can serve as a conduit for a general exploration of poorly understood evolution-to-ecology links. In this framework, known as ecological stoichiometry, the quantity of elements in the inorganic realm is a fundamental environment, while the flow of elements from the abiotic to the biotic realm is due to the action of genomes, with the unused elements excreted back into the inorganic realm affecting ecological processes at higher levels of organization. Ecological stoichiometry purposefully assumes distinct elemental composition of species, enabling powerful predictions about the ecological functions of species. However, this assumption results in a simplified view of the evolutionary mechanisms underlying diversification in the elemental composition of species. Recent research indicates substantial intraspecific variation in elemental composition and associated ecological functions such as nutrient excretion. We posit that attention to intraspecific variation in elemental composition will facilitate a synthesis of stoichiometric information in light of population genetics theory for a rigorous exploration of the ecological consequences of evolutionary change.},

  abstract = {Although the bulk of plant biomass contains relatively light, atmospherically derived elements (C, H, O, N, and S), 5\textendash 10\% of biomass is composed of heavier elements from soil minerals, such as Ca, Mg, K, and P. Plant uptake and cycling transport these heavier elements to the soil surface, resulting in shallower vertical distributions for strongly cycled elements than for other elements. In this paper, we evaluate the biogeochemical consequences of this process at different spatial and temporal scales based on chronose-quence studies and soil database analyses. In the bare coastal dunes of Argentina, the vertical distributions of exchangeable K ϩ (strongly cycled) and Na ϩ (more weakly cycled) were similar initially but diverged 15 years after pine afforestation, with K distributions becoming significantly concentrated in the surface and Na distributions becoming deeper. To evaluate the effects of plant stoichiometry on micronutrient distributions, chronose-quences of paired native grasslands (low Mn cycling) and eucalypt plantations (high Mn cycling) in the pampas of Argentina were also used. Within 50 years, eucalypts dramatically redistributed Mn pools toward the soil surface, reducing total pools by half at medium depths (20\textendash 60 cm) and increasing concentrations by up to an order of magnitude at the surface. Globally, we used generalized contrasts among exchangeable K, Na, and Mg in 7661 soil profiles to estimate the global magnitude of K uplift due to plant activity. Based on this calculation, the exchangeable K pool in the top 20 cm of soils without plant uplift would be 4\textendash 6 ϫ 10 15 g smaller globally, one-third to one-half smaller than its current size. Vegetation change alters the vertical distribution and bioavailability of mineral elements. Understanding how the stoichiometry of plant cycling affects soil nutrient distributions will help refine predictions of the biogeochemical consequences of current vegetation change.},

Because the long-phase species spend a longer time in terrestrial habitats such as grasslands or woodlands during their pre-reproductive phase, we hypothesized that long-phase species would be more sensitive to landscape structure than short-phase species. To test this hypothesis, we conducted periodic censuses of adult dragonflies at small man-made ponds. We compared the two above functional groups in terms of the degree to which species occurrence depended on landscape structure. The difference among the two groups was not significant, but occurrence of long-phase species tended to depend on landscape struc-ture. Long-phase species responded to landscape structure at larger spatial scales and showed stronger spatial autocorrelation in their occurrence among sampling ponds than short-phase species.},

We review available models that suggest the many different mechanisms that give rise to multiple elements, or colimitation. We then review recent empirical data that show that rates of decomposition and primary productivity may be limited by multiple elements. In that light, given the tropics' high species diversity and generally more weathered soils, we predict that colimitation at community and ecosystem scales is more prevalent closer to the equator. We conclude with suggestions for how to move forward with experimental studies of colimitation.},

In plants, sodium is found in low concentrations and has little metabolic function; in plant consumers, particularly animals, sodium is essential to running costly Na-K ATPases. Here I synthesise a diverse literature from physiology, agronomy and ecology, towards identifying sodium?s place as the ?7th macronutrient?, one whose shortfall targets two trophic levels ? herbivores and detritivores. I propose that sodium also plays a central, though unheralded role in herbivore digestion, via its importance to maintaining microbiomes and denaturing tannins. I highlight how sodium availability is a key determinant of consumer abundance and the geography of herbivory and detritivory. And I propose a re-appraisal of the assumption that, because sodium is metabolically unimportant to most plants, it is of little use. Instead, I suggest that sodium?s critical role in limiting herbivore performance makes it a commodity used by plants to manipulate their herbivores and mutualists, and by consumers like bison and elephants to generate grazing lawns: dependable sources of sodium.},

For example, planners might design a linkage between two conserved areas, or the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity might set targets for a well-connected system of protected areas for each nation. Here we describe 35 metrics that can quantify connectivity of focal patches or of networks and monitor changes over time in an ecoscape (landscape or seascape). The connectivity metrics fall into four categories: (1) structural connectivity metrics derived from binary maps and species-nonspecific spatial functions, (2) connectivity metrics derived from binary maps and species-specific population sizes and dispersal functions (3) metrics derived from multi-state maps and species responses to those states, and (4) metrics of functional connectivity reflecting observed flow of organisms or genes. We provide a decision tree to select which of these metrics are most appropriate for a given conservation goal and broad ecoscape context. Functional connectivity metrics may be preferred if conservation is focused on particular species or if data are available to parameterize models for a suite of species that represent needs of the focal biota. However, with climate change, ecoscapes need to facilitate movements of all species that need to adapt by shifting their ranges. Because an intact network of relatively natural areas may support movement for many species, structural metrics that consider the human footprint should be used in all coarse filter approxi\- mations of functional connectivity in shared ecoscapes.},

  abstract = {1. Dispersal is an important process for any organism, but especially for endangered species in fragmented landscapes. To enhance the dispersal of a certain species, connectivity measures are implemented, which require knowl-edge on the species' dispersal behaviour and habitat. It is often assumed, that the preferred reproductive habitat of a species is also used as the main dispersal habitat. Although this assumption has often been confirmed, there are also cases where it has been disproved. 2. With a combination of a mark-resight study and genetic analysis conducted in a fragmented agricultural landscape in Switzerland, the dispersal habitats of the threatened damselfly Coenagrion mercuriale were analysed for different distance classes. In addition, maximum dispersal distances were estimated. 3. The mark-resight study detected movement over short distances (500 m) mainly within the reproductive habitat of C. mercuriale (i.e. streams). 4. In contrast, the genetic study detected both short-and long-distance dis-persal. Short-distance dispersal occurred along streams, and discontinuity of streams hindered dispersal. Long-distance dispersal was suggested to happen along more or less straight lines and crossing agricultural land. Genetic analysis also showed that populations were well connected and that few individuals dis-persed over larger distances (4500 m). 5. Our study showed that connected reproductive habitat enhanced short-dis-tance dispersal in C. mercuriale. Although short-distance dispersal occurred fre-quently, long-distance dispersal was rare, but important to connect more isolated populations. Therefore, it would be relevant to differentiate between these two dispersal types when planning connectivity measures.},

However, traditional methods of measuring urban greenery involve limitations in coverage of various forms of greenery and do not reflect the actual degree of exposure to pedestrians. Accordingly, this study examined the street Green View Index (GVI) and its associations with walking activities by different income groups using survey data on walking behaviors in 2350 residents in Seoul, Korea. This study utilized Google Street View (GSV) and deep learning to calculate the GVI by semantic segmentation, referring to greenness from the visual perspective of pedestrians. Correlation analyses between traditional greenery variables and GVI were conducted to examine differences, and multiple regression models were applied to identify the relationships between walking time and greenery variables. The results of this study show differences between conventional greenery variables and GVI in terms of specific greenery forms and perspectives. As hypothesized, GVI was more closely associated with walking time than the traditional greenery variables. Also, this study found that the low-income residents generally lived in low GVI neighborhood, but walking time is more sensitive to GVI. These results were because GVI represents the actual greenery exposure to pedestrians, and there was a difference between income groups in the degree of vehicle usage in daily life. The results of this study indicate that, when analyzing the relationship between urban greenness and walking behavior, it is necessary to examine the relationship from multiple angles and to in\- vestigate the importance of eye-level street greenery. Our findings provide useful insights for public policies to promote pedestrian walking environments.},

For many wild living species, local extinctions of fragmented populations are common and recolonization is critical for regional survival. Successful recolonization depends on the availability of dispersing individuals and the degree of landscape connectivity. The obvious implications of landscape connectivity for conservation biology have led to a proliferation of connectivity measures. However, general relationships between landscape connectivity and landscape structure are lacking, and so are the relationships between different connectivity metrics. Consequently, there is a need to develop landscape metrics that more accurately characterize the landscape with an emphasis on the underlying processes. Here we review various definitions of landscape connectivity, explain their mathematical connotations, and make some unifying conclusions and suggestions for future research.},

  abstract = {The availability of industrial alkalinity sources is investigated to determine their potential for the simultaneous capture and sequestration of CO 2 from point-source emissions in the United States. Industrial alkalinity sources investigated include fly ash, cement kiln dust, and iron and steel slag. Their feasibility for mineral carbonation is determined by their relative abundance for CO 2 reactivity and their proximity to point-source CO 2 emissions. In addition, the available aggregate markets are investigated as possible sinks for mineral carbonation products. We show that in the U.S., industrial alkaline byproducts have the potential to mitigate approximately 7.6 Mt CO 2 /yr, of which 7.0 Mt CO 2 /yr are CO 2 captured through mineral carbonation and 0.6 Mt CO 2 /yr are CO 2 emissions avoided through reuse as synthetic aggregate (replacing sand and gravel). The emission reductions represent a small share (i.e., 0.1\%) of total U.S. CO 2 emissions; however, industrial byproducts may represent comparatively low-cost methods for the advancement of mineral carbonation technologies, which may be extended to more abundant yet expensive natural alkalinity sources.},

For the management of contaminated sites, risk assessment and control of natural attenuation, the assessment of in situ biodegradation and the underlying microbial processes is essential. The development of novel molecular methods, "omics" approaches, and high-throughput techniques has revealed new insight into complex microbial communities and their functions in anoxic environmental systems. This review summarizes recent advances in the application of molecular methods to study anaerobic microbial communities in contaminated terrestrial subsurface ecosystems. We focus on current approaches to analyze composition, dynamics, and functional diversity of subsurface communities, to link identity to activity and metabolic function, and to identify the ecophysiological role of not yet cultured microbes and syntrophic consortia. We discuss recent molecular surveys of contaminated sites from an ecological viewpoint regarding degrader ecotypes, abiotic factors shaping anaerobic communities, and biotic interactions underpinning the importance of microbial cooperation for microbial ecosystem services such as contaminant degradation.},

Despite the potential for species coexistence occurring at local or regional spatial scales, trade-offs are typically approached at a single scale. In recent years, ecologists have increasingly provided evidence for the importance of community processes at both local and regional spatial scales. This review summarizes the theoretical predictions for the traits associated with trade-offs under different conditions and at different spatial scales. We provide a spatial framework for understanding trade-offs, coexistence and the supportive empirical evidence. Predictions are presented that link the patterns of diversity observed to the patterns of trade-offs that lead to coexistence at different spatial scales. Recent evidence for the evolution of trade-offs under different conditions is provided which explores both laboratory microcosm studies and phylogenetic tests. Examining trade-offs within a spatial framework can provide a strong approach to understanding community structure and dynamics, while explaining patterns of species diversity.},

  abstract = {Background: Artificial boundaries on a map occur when the map extent does not cover the entire area of study; edges on the map do not exist on the ground. These artificial boundaries might bias the results of animal dispersal models by creating artificial barriers to movement for model organisms where there are no barriers for real organisms. Here, we characterize the effects of artificial boundaries on calculations of landscape resistance to movement using circuit theory. We then propose and test a solution to artificially inflated resistance values whereby we place a buffer around the artificial boundary as a substitute for the true, but unknown, habitat. Methodology/Principal Findings: We randomly assigned landscape resistance values to map cells in the buffer in proportion to their occurrence in the known map area. We used circuit theory to estimate landscape resistance to organism movement and gene flow, and compared the output across several scenarios: a habitat-quality map with artificial boundaries and no buffer, a map with a buffer composed of randomized habitat quality data, and a map with a buffer composed of the true habitat quality data. We tested the sensitivity of the randomized buffer to the possibility that the composition of the real but unknown buffer is biased toward high or low quality. We found that artificial boundaries result in an overestimate of landscape resistance. Conclusions/Significance: Artificial map boundaries overestimate resistance values. We recommend the use of a buffer composed of randomized habitat data as a solution to this problem. We found that resistance estimated using the randomized buffer did not differ from estimates using the real data, even when the composition of the real data was varied. Our results may be relevant to those interested in employing Circuitscape software in landscape connectivity and landscape genetics studies.},

We present a method that does not require independent, field-collected data, is insensitive to the placement of source and destination sites (nodes) for modeling connectivity, and does not require the selection of a focal species. In the first step of our approach, we created a cost surface that represented permeability of the landscape to movement for a suite of species. We randomly selected nodes around the perimeter of the buffered study area and used circuit theory to connect pairs of nodes. When the buffer was removed, the resulting current density map represented, for each grid cell, the probability of use by moving animals. We found that using nodes that were randomly located around the perimeter of the buffered study area was less biased by node placement than randomly selecting nodes within the study area. We also found that a buffer of {$\geq$} 20\% of the study area width was sufficient to remove the effects of node placement on current density. We tested our method by creating a map of connectivity in the Algonquin to Adirondack region in eastern North America, and we validated the map with independently collected data. We found that amphibians and reptiles were more likely to cross roads in areas of high current density, and fishers (Pekania [Martes] pennanti) used areas with high current density within their home ranges. Our approach provides an efficient and cost effective method of predicting areas with relatively high landscape connectivity for multiple species..},

  abstract = {A "landscape of fear" (LOF) is a map that describes continuous spatial variation in an animal's perception of predation risk. The relief on this map reflects, for example, places that an animal avoids to minimize risk. Although the LOF concept is a potential unifying theme in ecology that is often invoked to explain the ecological and conservation significance of fear, quantified examples of a LOF over large spatial scales are lacking as is knowledge about the daily dynamics of a LOF. Despite theory and data to the contrary, investigators often assume, implicitly or explicitly, that a LOF is a static consequence of a predator's mere presence. We tested the prediction that a LOF in a large-scale, free-living system is a highly-dynamic map with "peaks" and "valleys" that alternate across the diel (24-hour) cycle in response to daily lulls in predator activity. We did so with extensive data from the case study of Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) and wolves (Canis lupus) that was the original basis for the LOF concept. We quantified the elk LOF, defined here as spatial allocation of time away from risky places and times, across nearly 1000-km2 of northern Yellowstone National Park and found that it fluctuated with the crepuscular activity pattern of wolves, enabling elk to use risky places during wolf downtimes. This may help explain evidence that wolf predation risk has no effect on elk stress levels, body condition, pregnancy, or herbivory. The ability of free-living animals to adaptively allocate habitat use across periods of high and low predator activity within the diel cycle is an underappreciated aspect of animal behavior that helps explain why strong antipredator responses may trigger weak ecological effects, and why a LOF may have less conceptual and practical importance than direct killing.},

Many studies have examined this behavior using optimal foraging theory as the theoretical framework, which explains that animals behave in a way that optimizes net energy intake (calculated by dividing the difference in energy obtained from prey and energy expended for foraging by the total time engaging in these behaviors). This study simulated the foraging situation assumed in Charnov's (Theoretical Population Biology, 9, 129\textendash 136, 1976) marginal value theorem\textemdash namely, where food is located in patches separated by areas without food. To quantitatively analyze the behavior of homing pigeons (Columba livia) in terms of the marginal value theorem, we conducted a series of experiments using a reinforcement schedule that controls the energy of responses (Kono, Learning \& Behavior, 41,425\textendash 432, 2013). Experiment 1 revealed that pigeons' behavior was qualitatively consistent with the prediction of the marginal value theorem, but the energy schedule weakly controlled the energy expenditure of behavior. In Experiment 2, the procedure was modified to more strictly control energy expenditure. The results showed that the pigeons' behavior was relatively close to that of the predicted value of the marginal value theorem. Overall, then, pigeons behaved optimally in foraging as predicted by the marginal value theorem. However, individual differences were observed, particularly when schedule requirements were high. Future studies should examine the underlying cause of this result.},

  abstract = {P{$>$} Cross-ecosystem movements of resources, including detritus, nutrients and living prey, can strongly influence food web dynamics in recipient habitats. Variation in resource inputs is thought to be driven by factors external to the recipient habitat (e.g. donor habitat productivity and boundary conditions). However, inputs of or by 'active' living resources may be strongly influenced by recipient habitat quality when organisms exhibit behavioural habitat selection when crossing ecosystem boundaries. To examine whether behavioural responses to recipient habitat quality alter the relative inputs of 'active' living and 'passive' detrital resources to recipient food webs, we manipulated the presence of caged predatory fish and measured biomass, energy and organic content of inputs to outdoor experimental pools of adult aquatic insects, frog eggs, terrestrial plant matter and terrestrial arthropods. Caged fish reduced the biomass, energy and organic matter donated to pools by tree frog eggs by similar to 70\%, but did not alter insect colonisation or passive allochthonous inputs of terrestrial arthropods and plant material. Terrestrial plant matter and adult aquatic insects provided the most energy and organic matter inputs to the pools (40-50\%), while terrestrial arthropods provided the least (7\%). Inputs of frog egg were relatively small but varied considerably among pools and over time (3\%, range = 0-20\%). Absolute and proportional amounts varied by input type. Aquatic predators can strongly affect the magnitude of active, but not passive, inputs and that the effect of recipient habitat quality on active inputs is variable. Furthermore, some active inputs (i.e. aquatic insect colonists) can provide similar amounts of energy and organic matter as passive inputs of terrestrial plant matter, which are well known to be important. Because inputs differ in quality and the trophic level they subsidise, proportional changes in input type could have strong effects on recipient food webs. Cross-ecosystem resource inputs have previously been characterised as donor-controlled. However, control by the recipient food web could lead to greater feedback between resource flow and consumer dynamics than has been appreciated so far.},

  abstract = {Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists from the time of Charles Elton in the 1920s. The discovery of large population fluctuations in undisturbed ecosystems challenged the idea that pristine nature was in a state of balance. The 10-year cycle of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben) across the boreal forests of Canada and Alaska is a classic cycle, recognized by fur traders for more than 300 years. Since the 1930s, ecologists have investigated the mechanisms that might cause these cycles. Proposed causal mechanisms have varied from sunspots to food supplies, parasites, diseases, predation and social behaviour. Both the birth rate and the death rate change dramatically over the cycle. Social behaviour was eliminated as a possible cause because snowshoe hares are not territorial and do not commit infanticide. Since the 1960s, large-scale manipulative experiments have been used to discover the major limiting factors. Food supply and predation quickly became recognized as potential key factors causing the cycle. Experiments adding food and restricting predator access to field populations have been decisive in pinpointing predation as the key mechanism causing these fluctuations. The immediate cause of death of most snowshoe hares is predation by a variety of predators, including the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis Kerr). The collapse in the reproductive rate is not due to food shortage as was originally thought, but is a result of chronic stress from predator chases. Five major issues remain unresolved. First, what is the nature of the predator-induced memory that results in the prolonged low phase of the cycle? Second, why do hare cycles form a travelling wave, starting in the centre of the boreal forest in Saskatchewan and travelling across western Canada and Alaska? Third, why does the amplitude of the cycle vary greatly from one cycle to the next in the same area? Fourth, do the same mechanisms of population limitation apply to snowshoe hares in eastern North American or in similar ecosystems across Siberia? Finally, what effect will climatic warming have on all the above issues? The answers to these questions remain for future generations of biologists to determine.},

In contrast, experimental studies of biodiversity\textendash function examine communities whose structures often differ markedly from those providing services in real landscapes. A bridge is needed between these two approaches. To develop this research agenda, I discuss critical questions and key approaches in four areas: (1) identifying the important `ecosystem service providers'; (2) determining the various aspects of community structure that influence function in real landscapes, especially compensatory community responses that stabilize function, or non-random extinction sequences that rapidly erode it; (3) assessing key environmental factors influencing provision of services, and (4) measuring the spatio-temporal scale over which providers and services operate.

  abstract = {Butterflies rank among the most threatened animal groups throughout Europe. However, current population trends differ among species. The nettle-feeding butterflies Aglais io and Aglais urticae cope successfully with the anthropogenic land-use change. Both species are assumed to be pre-adapted to higher nitrogen contents in their host plant, stinging nettle (Urtica dioica). However, it is currently unknown, whether this pre-adaptation enables both Aglais species to cope successfully or even to benefit from the excessive nitrogen availabilities in nettles growing in modern farmlands. For this reason, this study focused on the response of both Aglais species to unfertilized nettles compared to nettles receiving 150 or 300 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (i.e., common fertilizer quantities of modern-day agriculture). Fertilized nettles were characterized by higher nitrogen concentrations and lower C:N ratios compared to the control group. In both Aglais species, the individuals feeding on fertilized nettles had higher survival rates, shorter larval periods and heavier pupae and, in A. urticae also longer forewings. All these trait shifts are beneficial for the individuals, lowering their risk to die before reproduction and increasing their reproductive potential. These responses agree with the well-accepted nitrogen-limitation hypothesis predicting a positive relationship between the nitrogen content of the diet and the performance of herbivorous insects. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the increasing abundance of both Aglais species may result not only from the increasing spread of nettles into the farmland but also from changes in their quality due to the eutrophication of the landscape during recent decades.},

  abstract = {Litter decomposition rate (k) is typically estimated from proportional litter mass loss data using models that assume constant, normally distributed errors. However, such data often show non-normal errors with reduced variance near bounds (0 or 1), potentially leading to biased k estimates. We compared the performance of nonlinear regression using the beta distribution, which is well-suited to bounded data and this type of heteroscedasticity, to standard nonlinear regression (normal errors) on simulated and real litter decomposition data. Although the beta model often provided better fits to the simulated data (based on the corrected Akaike Information Criterion, AIC c), standard nonlinear regression was robust to violation of homoscedasticity and gave equally or more accurate k estimates as nonlinear beta regression. Our simulation results also suggest that k estimates will be most accurate when study length captures mid to late stage decomposition (50-80\% mass loss) and the number of measurements through time is \$5. Regression method and data transformation choices had the smallest impact on k estimates during mid and late stage decomposition. Estimates of k were more variable among methods and generally less accurate during early and end stage decomposition. With real data, neither model was predominately best; in most cases the models were indistinguishable based on AIC c , and gave similar k estimates. However, when decomposition rates were high, normal and beta model k estimates often diverged substantially. Therefore, we recommend a pragmatic approach where both models are compared and the best is selected for a given data set. Alternatively, both models may be used via model averaging to develop weighted parameter estimates. We provide code to perform nonlinear beta regression with freely available software.},

  abstract = {The involvement of weakly adsorbed water in multiple mechanistic steps is also consistent with the large reaction order (1.3). DFT calculations also indicate that a second adsorbed water molecule in the vicinity of the *COOH species facilitates the proton transfer, which only needs to overcome the thermodynamic barrier (DE = 0.70 eV, E a = 0.70 eV, SM 6.6). Further, at higher water coverage, rapid proton mobility (33) can explain the shift to an equilibrium isotope effect. *COOH decomposition has also been identified as the RDS in the related WGS reaction on Cu and Pt (34, 35), and this elementary step is consistent with reports of NaOH promoting CO oxidation over Au catalysts (17, 36). The CO oxidation mechanism shown in Fig. 4, along with the structural model of support OH groups anchoring and activating water near Au particles, provides a fresh framework for interpreting previous results. This model provides a single active-site description that unifies some very disparate mechanistic information, accounts for the promotional effects of water, and is consistent with previously reported isotope exchange studies (21, 27) that indicate that CO and O 2 must react directly on the Au particles without exchanging O atoms with the support or adsorbed water. At the same time, it maintains the importance of the support OH groups and the metal-support interface without directly involving them in the reaction mechanism. The likely active sites bear a strong resemblance to the WGS mechanism over Au catalysts, where the support anchors water near Au-CO sites (6). This proposed mechanism explains why the O 2 adsorption and activation steps, which are widely regarded as the critical mechanistic steps, have been so difficult to characterize. The fast room-temperature catalysis mechanism requires both water and CO for O 2 binding and activation. Experiments performed without water, particularly ultrahigh-vacuum and DFT studies, ultimately probe different reaction mechanisms than what appears to be the dominant room-temperature pathway on supported catalysts. Similarly, most traditional catalyst studies rarely control or report feedwater contents, which has likely contributed to the wide range of reported CO oxidation activities for Au/TiO 2 catalysts and to the difficulties in understanding the key features of the best catalysts. Finally, this new mechanism brings the interpretation of traditional supported catalyst experiments more in line with computational and surface-science studies, which have largely indicated that the key reaction steps occur on Au (7, 9-14, 17, 29), without direct participation of the support.},

The higher C in conifers agrees with their higher lignin content ({$\sim$} 30\%, versus {$\sim$} 20\% for hardwoods). Wood-meal samples drilled from discrete early wood and late wood zones of seven of the forty-one species were also investigated. C contents of early woods were invariably higher than those in corresponding late woods, again in agreement with early wood having higher lignin content. Further investigation was made into freshly harvested wood of some species to determine how much volatile C is present, comparing oven-dried wood meal with wood meal dried at ambient temperature over a desiccant. C contents of oven-dried woods were signi\"ycantly lower, indicating that all past data on C content in oven-or kiln-dried woods may be inaccurate in relation to the true C content of forests. We conclude that C content varies substantially among species as well as within individual trees. Clearly, a 50\% generic value is an oversimpli\"ycation of limited application in relation to global warming and the concept of "carbon credits".},

The aim of this study was to provide data on the safety of this treatment pattern, which is of interest to clinicians, regulators, and the public. Methods: A meta-analysis of individual patient data from 67 studies spon-sored by Bayer HealthCare was completed. The primary endpoints were patient-reported gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs); the secondary endpoints were the incidence of patient-reported non-GI AEs. Event in-cidence and odds ratios (ORs) based on Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel estimates are reported. In total, 6181 patients were treated with ASA, 3515 with pla-cebo, 1145 with acetaminophen (paracetamol), and 754 with ibuprofen. Ex-posure to ASA was short term (82.5\% of patients had a single dose). Results: GI AEs were more frequent with ASA (9.9\%) than with placebo (9.0\%) [OR 1.3; 95\% CI 1.1, 1.5]. Dyspeptic symptoms were infrequent (4.6\% in placebo subjects). The ORs for ASA were 1.3 (95\% CI 1.1, 1.6) versus placebo; 1.55 (95\% CI 0.7, 3.3) versus ibuprofen; and 1.04 (95\% CI 0.8, 1.4) versus acetaminophen. There were very few serious GI AEs (one ASA case; three placebo cases). No differences were found for non-GI AEs and no cases of cerebral hemorrhage were reported. \textordfeminine{} 2011 Lanas et al., publisher and licensee Adis Data Information BV.

  abstract = {Environmental inequality is a phenomenon drawing much attention in the scientific and policy-making debates about urban forests and city greening. Most studies on the subject have shown that socially vulnerable, multicultural neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by the lack of urban forest while richer neighborhoods tend to be greener. But are there differences in the resilience of urban forests between poor and rich neighborhoods? We tackled this question using a newly developed indicator of urban forest resilience, functional diversity, to determine if environmental injustice is also found in the resilience of urban forests in poor neighborhoods. Using Canadian census data at the census tract scale, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and urban tree inventories, this study investigated if urban forest resilience is also part of the environmental inequality phenomenon in four urban areas in eastern Canada: Toronto, Gatineau-Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec City. Multivariate analysis of the dataset shows that urban forest functional diversity, used as an indicator of resilience, is inversely correlated to a set of variables associated with social vulnerability. The same relationship also exists with canopy cover; a pattern of inequality found in many cities around the world. With these findings, we show that social vulnerability and urban forest resilience are intertwined, meaning that neighborhoods already lacking urban forest are also more at risk of losing it due to a sudden environmental disturbance. When confronted with global change, considering this new insight into urban environmental inequality could be of great importance for maintaining a comfortable living environment for every city-dweller.},

Increases in host contact rates or births drive seasonal epidemics in some systems, but other factors may occasionally override these influences. White-nose syndrome, caused by the emerging fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans, is spreading across North America and threatens several bat species with extinction. We examined patterns and drivers of seasonal transmission of P. destructans by measuring infection prevalence and pathogen loads in six bat species at 30 sites across the eastern United States. Bats became transiently infected in autumn, and transmission spiked in early winter when bats began hibernating. Nearly all bats in six species became infected by late winter when infection intensity peaked. In summer, despite high contact rates and a birth pulse, most bats cleared infections and prevalence dropped to zero. These data suggest the dominant driver of seasonal transmission dynamics was a change in host physiology, specifically hibernation. Our study is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to describe the seasonality of transmission in this emerging wildlife disease. The timing of infection and fungal growth resulted in maximal population impacts, but only moderate rates of spatial spread.},

Similarly, prey avoid chemical cues from predators at feeding sites, presumably because risk of death outweighs the benefit of food. This study addressed the lack of information regarding mammals' avoidance of direct cues from competitors and also examined how indirect cues, i.e., vegetative cover, affect foraging behavior. To test if chemical cues and vegetative cover alter the number of visits by prey species and time spent at feeding plots, we observed snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) in plots containing coyote (Canis latrans; predator) and moose (Alces alces; competitor) urine across a spectrum of vegetation densities. Snowshoe hares significantly reduced number of visits to plots that contained coyote or moose urine. In plots treated with coyote urine, number of visits decreased significantly as plots became more densely vegetated. Neither chemical cues nor vegetation density affected time spent in plots. These results suggest that competition between snowshoe hares and moose has selected for an avoidance response. This study also reinforces the idea that an increase in vegetation density could prove disadvantageous to prey, perhaps because some predators use dense vegetation to their advantage.},

The numerous needs identified by municipalities show that there is a strong demand for research in this area. In particular, municipalities want to know: a) which tree species are better adapted to urban settings; b) the effects of trees on rainwater runoff and on human health; and c) that more studies be conducted on topics such as trees and infrastructure, on hazardous trees, on invasive plant species, and on various tree pests. Our analysis reveals that small municipalities are less interested in certain needs than larger municipalities, and that municipalities in the Maritimes region show more interest in certain topics than those in other Canadian regions. Results also reveal that urban forest canopy size has no influence on the identified needs. This study allows researchers to better define their projects, and it highlights the importance of improving knowledge exchange with and among key stakeholders in cities actively pursuing and interested in urban forestry activities.},

I used a one predator-one-prey system, puma (Puma concolor)-mu\textbackslash Q deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to test the following predictions regarding predator-prey distribution and patch use by the predator. (1) Pumas will spend more time in high prey risk/low prey use habitat types, while deer will spend their time in low-risk habitats. Pumas should (2) select large forage patches more often, (3) remain in large patches longer, and (4) revisit individual large patches more often than individual smaller ones. I tested these predictions with an extensive telemetry data set collected over 16 years in a study area of patchy forested habitat. When active, pumas spent significantly less time in open areas of low intrinsic pr?dation risk than did deer. Pumas used large patches more than expected, revisited individual large patches significantly more often than smaller ones, and stayed significantly longer in larger patches than in smaller ones. The results supported the prediction of a negative relationship in the spatial distribution of a predator and its prey and indicated that the predator is incorporating the prey's imperfect information about its presence. These results indicate a behavioral complexity on the landscape scale that can have far-reaching impacts on predator-prey interactions.},

We further evaluated this technique's ability to capture seasonal and cyclical patterns of snowshoe hare glucocorticoid secretion from 2013 to 2015 in the southwestern Yukon (Canada). We found positive correlations (R2 = 0.20\textendash 0.32) in all pairwise comparisons among body regions, and differences among individuals accounted for the greatest proportion of variance (47.3\%) in measurements.

We found a significant increase in hare hair cortisol concentrations across this time period. Cortisol indices were higher in summer than winter pelage, reflecting predicted physiological responses to seasonal variation in food availability and individual risk. Variation in hair cortisol concentrations was more similar to long-term (weeks-months) integrative indices of adrenal capacity than point samples of fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations. Overall, we find that hair cortisol analysis is a simple and useful tool for estimations of population-level stress physiology in wild mammals, and sampling of core body regions with consistent moulting patterns produced the most robust results in this species.},

  abstract = {Ecological stoichiometry has generated new insights into how the balance of elements affects ecological interactions and ecosystem processes, but little is known about the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of stoichiometric traits. Understanding the origins and drivers of stoichiometric trait variation between and within species will improve our understanding about the ecological responses of communities to environmental change and the ecosystem effects of organisms. In addition, studying the plasticity, heritability, and genetic basis of stoichiometric traits might improve predictions about how organisms adapt to changing environmental conditions, and help to identify interactions and feedbacks between phenotypic evolution and ecosystem processes. Ecological Stoichiometry: A Functional Trait Perspective There is a growing interest in understanding intraspecific functional trait variability so as to make better predictions about population dynamics, species interactions, and ecosystem functioning [1,2]. Although stoichiometric traits (see Glossary) are useful for connecting organisms to ecosystem processes [3-5], little is known about how intraspecific variation in these traits mediates ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Stoichiometric traits are an integral part of ecological stoichiometry (ES) theory, which focuses on the balance of multiple elements in ecological interactions and ecosystem processes [6]. Stoichiometric traits can vary among species [5-7], populations, and individuals of the same species [8-10], can influence how organisms affect energy flow and nutrient cycling in ecosystems (i.e., as functional effect traits) [6,11], and can mediate evolutionary responses to environmental variation and change (i.e., as functional response traits) [4,5]. Recent studies have also begun to document the occurrence [8,12,13] and ecological consequences [3,14] of rapid evolution of stoichiometric traits. Overall, such stoichiometric traits are a useful focal point for studying both interactions and feedbacks between phenotypic evolution and ecosystem processes. ES theory posits that performance (e.g., growth rate) is partly determined by the match between the stoichiometry of resources and organism elemental phenotype (EP), which comprises multiple stoichiometric traits. However, what is the relationship between stoichiometric traits and fitness variation, and, more generally, how do organisms adapt to elemental imbalances in their diet or their resource uptake? Increasing nutrient supply can impact on the evolution of life-history traits by changing allocation trade-offs, particularly those associated with nutrient imbalances that negatively influence performance [15,16]. For example, we might expect either directional selection on stoichiometric traits to reduce elemental imbalances between a population and its resources [15,17], or fluctuating selection to maintain stoichiometric trait variation within populations when there is variation in resource quality through time. It is also possible that agents of selection on stoichiometric traits vary in their importance over the lifetime of organisms [15]. Juveniles and adults often vary in their nutritional needs because the nutritional demands for rapid growth (e.g., high dietary phosphorus, P) early in life might differ from those for Trends There is growing evidence for intraspe-cific variation in stoichiometric traits of animals, for a genetic basis of this variation , and for rapid evolution of these traits. In light of such observations, ecological stoichiometry has the potential to address evolutionary processes and identify mechanisms by which environmental heterogeneity drives the origins of biological diversity. We suggest that addressing the evolution of stoichiometric reaction-norms could help in understanding when, and to what extent, variability in elemental phenotype in natural populations is due to plasticity of stoichiometric traits or genetic variation. We also propose strengthening the link between stoichio-metric trait variability and fitness by building on nutritional geometry theory and function-valued methods. In addition , and because stoichiometric traits may not only respond to environmental variation but also influence ecosystem dynamics, studying the elemental phenotypes can contribute to our understanding of the nature of eco-evolutionary feedbacks.},

  abstract = {Our meta-analysis of 126 nitrogen addition experiments evaluated nitrogen (N) limitation of net primary production (NPP) in terrestrial ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that N limitation is widespread among biomes and influenced by geography and climate. We used the response ratio (R ffi ANPPN/ANPPctrl) of aboveground plant growth in fertilized to control plots and found that most ecosystems are nitrogen limited with an average 29\% growth response to nitrogen (i.e., R {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.29). The response ratio was significant within temperate forests (R {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.19), tropical forests (R {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.60), temperate grasslands (R {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.53), tropical grasslands (R {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.26), wetlands (R {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.16), and tundra (R {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.35), but not deserts. Eight tropical forest studies had been conducted on very young volcanic soils in Hawaii, and this subgroup was strongly N limited (R {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2.13), which resulted in a negative correlation between forest R and latitude. The degree of N limitation in the remainder of the tropical forest studies (R {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.20) was comparable to that of temperate forests, and when the young Hawaiian subgroup was excluded, forest R did not vary with latitude. Grassland response increased with latitude, but was independent of temperature and precipitation. These results suggest that the global N and C cycles interact strongly and that geography can mediate ecosystem response to N within certain biome types.},

Streamside herbs, grasses and shrubs have the potential to fulfill several functions upon which adjacent stream ecosystems rely, such as providing detritus and prey to aquatic communities. Here we investigated patterns of riparian understory vegetation and the associated invertebrate community along headwater streams in deciduous broadleaf forest managed under traditional silvicultural practices. We studied eleven sites along a large gradient of overstory canopy openness to assess whether and how resource competition with canopy trees limits the growth of riparian understory vegetation and affects the abundance and community composition of understory invertebrates. We found that the height and above ground biomass of understory vegetation increased steadily with decreasing overstory canopy cover, suggesting that the structure of riparian zones is contingent upon antagonistic interactions between overstory and understory plants. We also observed that invertebrate abundance did not track changes in overstory canopy cover and understory plant biomass although some numerically important invertebrate taxa displayed clear preferences to either closed or open-canopy riparian forest. Our findings demonstrate that riparian understory vegetation can achieve fairly high biomass and, therefore, should help maintain inputs of plant litter to aquatic ecosystems in harvested or naturally disturbed riparian forest. Because understory invertebrates may not fully compensate for reduced inputs of canopy invertebrates to streams, retaining trees along streams may still be the most effective management option for headwater streams.},

Yet we lack an understanding of how the spatial patterns in organismal stoichiometry affect biogeochemical processes and the tools to predict the impacts of global changes on biogeochemical processes. In this contribution we develop stoichiometric distribution models (StDMs), which allow us to map spatial structure in resource elemental composition across a landscape and evaluate spatial responses of consumers. We parameterise StDMs for a consumer-resource (moose-white birch) system and demonstrate that we can develop predictive models of resource stoichiometry across a landscape and that such models could improve our predictions of consumer space use. With results from our study system application, we argue that explicit consideration of the spatial patterns in organismal elemental composition may uncover emergent individual, population, community and ecosystem properties that are not revealed at the local extents routinely used in ecological stoichiometry. We discuss perspectives for further developments and application of StDMs to advance three emerging frameworks for spatial ecosystem ecology in an era of global change; meta-ecosystem theory, macroecological stoichiometry and remotely sensed biogeochemistry. Progress on these emerging frameworks will allow for the integration of ecological stoichiometry and individual space use and fitness.},

Applied ecology is becoming increasingly quantitative and model selection via information criteria has become a common statistical modeling approach. Unfortunately, parameters that contain little to no useful information are commonly presented and interpreted as important in applied ecology. I review the concept of an uninformative parameter in model selection using information criteria and perform a literature review to measure the prevalence of uninformative parameters in model selection studies applying Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) in 2014 in four of the top journals in applied ecology (Biological Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecological Applications, Journal of Applied Ecology). Twenty-one percent of studies I reviewed applied AIC metrics. Many (31.5\%) of the studies applying AIC metrics in the four applied ecology journals I reviewed had or were very likely to have uninformative parameters in a model set. In addition, more than 40\% of studies reviewed had insufficient information to assess the presence or absence of uninformative parameters in a model set. Given the prevalence of studies likely to have uninformative parameters or with insufficient information to assess parameter status (71.5\%), I surmise that much of the policy recommendations based on applied ecology research may not be supported by the data analysis. I provide four warning signals and a decision tree to assist authors, reviewers, and editors to screen for uninformative parameters in studies applying model selection with information criteria. In the end, careful thinking at every step of the scientific process and greater reporting standards are required to detect uninformative parameters in studies adopting an information criteria approach.},

  abstract = {Social structure is a fundamental component of a population that drives ecological and evolutionary processes ranging from parasite transmission to sexual selection. Nevertheless, we have much to learn about factors that explain variation in social structure. We used advances in biologging and social network analysis to experimentally test how the local habitat, and specifically habitat complexity, modulates social structure at different levels in wild populations. Sleepy lizards, Tiliqua rugosa, establish nonrandom social networks that are characterized by avoidance of some neighbours and frequent interactions with one opposite-sex individual. Using synchronous GPS locations of all adult lizards, we constructed social networks based on spatial proximity of individuals. We increased habitat structural complexity in two study populations by adding 100 short fences across the landscape. We then compared the resulting movement behaviour and social structure between these populations and two unmanipulated populations. Social connectivity (network density) and social stability, measured at weekly intervals, were greater in populations with increased habitat structural complexity. The level of agonistic interaction (quantified as scale damage) was also higher, indicating a fitness cost of greater social connectivity. However, some network parameters were unaffected by increased complexity, including disassortative mixing by sex, and at the individual level, social differentiation among associates (coefficient of variation of edge weights) and maximal interaction frequencies (maximal edge weight). This suggests divergent effects of changed ecological conditions on individual association behaviour compared to the resulting social structure of the population. Our results contrast with those from studies of more gregarious species, in which higher structural complexity in the environment relaxed the social connectivity. This shows that the response to altered ecological conditions can differ fundamentally between species or between populations, and we suggest that it depends on their tendency for gregarious behaviour.},

Extensive research has shown that a decrease in species diversity and an increase in productivity are a common phenomenon following fertilization in grasslands ecosystem. The magnitude of the response of species diversity and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) to fertilization mainly depends on species traits (mean trait values) and traits variability (plasticity). Our aim of this study was to examine (i) changes of species diversity (species richness and Shannon-Wiener index) and ANPP following fertilization; (ii) which species traits or community-weighted mean (CWM) traits can determine ANPP, as expected from the 'biomass ratio hypothesis'; and (iii) the relative role of intra-specific and inter-specific trait variability in this process following fertilization. Methods We measured ANPP and four key plant functional traits: specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), mature plant height (MPH) and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) for 25 component species along a fertilization gradient in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, trait variation of species was assessed using coefficients of variation (CV), and we calculated the ratio of the CV intra to the CV inter. Important Findings Our results showed that: (i) fertilization significantly reduced species richness and Shannon-Weiner diversity index, but significantly increased ANPP; (ii) there was a significant positive correlation between ANPP and CWM-SLA and CWM-MPH, yet there was no significant relationship between ANPP and CWM-LNC or CWM-LDMC; (iii) intra-specific variability in SLA and MPH was found to be much greater than inter-specific variability, especially at the higher fertilization levels. We concluded that CWM-SLA and CWM-MPH can be used to assess the impacts of species changes on ecosystem functioning, and dominant species can maximize resource use through intra-specific variability in SLA and MPH to compensate for the loss of species following fertilization, therefore maintaining high community productivity.},

However, we know little about the temporal patterns of C:N stoichiometry during forest development. The goal of this study is to explore the temporal patterns of intraspecific and ecosystem components' variations in C:N stoichiometry and the scaling relationships between C and N at different successional stages. Methods Along forest development in a natural temperate forest, northeastern China, four age gradients were categorized into ca. 10-, 30-, 70-and 200-year old, respectively, and three 20 m \texttimes{} 20 m plots were set up for each age class. Leaves, branches, fine roots and fresh litter of seven dominant species as well as mineral soil at depth of 0-10 cm were sampled. A Universal CHN Elemental Analyzer was used to determine the C and N concentrations in all samples. Important Findings Intraspecific leaf C, N and C:N ratios remained stable along forest development regardless of tree species; while C, N concentrations and C:N ratios changed significantly either in branches or in fine roots, and they varied with tree species except Populus davidiana (P {$<$} 0.05). For ecosystem components, we discovered that leaf C:N ratios remained stable when stand age was below ca. 70 years and dominant tree species were light-demanding pioneers such as Betula platyphylla and Populus davidiana, while increased significantly at the age of ca. 200 years with Pinus koraiensis as the dominant species. C:N ratios in branches and fresh litter did not changed significantly along forest development stages. C concentrations scaled isometrically with respect to N concentrations in mineral soil but not in other ecosystem components. Our results indicate that, leaf has a higher intraspecific C:N stoichiometric stability compared to branch and fine root, whereas for ecosystem components, shifts in species composition mainly affect C:N ratios in leaves rather than other components. This study also demonstrated that C and N remain coupled in mineral soils but not in plant organs or fresh litter during forest development.},

Predation has long been implicated as a major selective force in the evolution of several morphological and behavioral characteristics of animals. The importance of predation during evolutionary time is clear, but growing evidence suggests that animals also have the ability to assess and behaviorally influence their risk of being preyed upon in ecological time (i.e., during their lifetime). We develop an abstraction of the predation process in which several components of predation risk are identified. A review of the literature indicates that an animal's ability to assess and behaviorally control one or more of these components strongly influences decision making in feeding animals, as well as in animals deciding when and how to escape predators, when and how to be social, or even, for fishes, when and how to breathe air. This review also reveals that such decision making reflects apparent trade-offs between the risk of predation and the benefits to be gained from engaging in a given activity. Despite this body of evidence, several areas in the study of animal behavior have received little or no attention from a predation perspective. We identify several such areas, the most important of which is that dealing with animal reproduction. Much work also remains regarding the precise nature of the risk of predation and how it is actually perceived by animals, and the extent to which they can behaviorally control their risk of predation. Mathematical models will likely play a major role in future work, and we suggest that modelers strive to consider the potential complexity in behavioral responses to predation risk. Overall, since virtually every animal is potential prey for others, research that seriously considers the influence of predation risk will provide significant insight into the nature of animal behavior.

  abstract = {The rapid response of animals to changes in predation risk has allowed behavioral ecologists to learn much about antipredator decision making. A largely unappreciated aspect of such decision making, however, is that it may be fundamentally driven by the very thing that allows it to be so readily studied: temporal variation in risk. We show theoretically that temporal variability in risk leaves animals with the problem of allocating feeding and antipredator efforts across different risk situations. Our analysis suggests that an animal should exhibit its greatest antipredator behavior in high-risk situations that are brief and infrequent. An animal should also allocate more antipredator effort to high-risk situations and more feeding to low-risk situations, with an increase in the relative degree of risk in high-risk situations. However, the need to feed leaves an animal with little choice but to decrease its allocation of antipredator effort to high-risk situations as they become more frequent or lengthy; here, antipredator effort in low-risk situations may drop to low levels as an animal allocates as much feeding as possible to brief periods of low risk. These conclusions hold under various scenarios of interrupted feeding, state-dependent behavior, and stochastic variation in risk situations. Our analysis also suggests that a common experimental protocol, in which prey animals are maintained under low risk and then exposed to a brief ``pulse'' of high risk, is likely to overestimate the intensity of antipredator behavior expected under field situations or chronic exposure to high risk.},

  abstract = {Urban forest modeling is becoming increasingly complex, global, and transdisciplinary. Increased modeling of urban forest structure and function presents an urgent need for comparative studies to assess the similarities and differences between modeling techniques and applications. This paper provides a systematic review of 242 journal papers over the past two-decades, and identifies 476 case studies. We assess model case studies among different locations, units and scales, compare the ability and functional capacity of the models and different tools, compare papers published in different disciplines, and identify new emerging topics in the field of urban forest modeling. Conclusions from this analysis include: (1) the spatial distribution of case studies is primarily clustered around the US, Europe, and China, with the most popular units to model being streets and parks; (2) the most commonly used model types are the i-Tree toolset, ENVI-met, computational fluid dynamic models, and the Hedonic price model; (3) uncertainty assessment of urban forest models is limited; (4) spatially explicit models are critically important for estimating of ecosystem services as well as for environment management; (5) most case studies focus on biophysical benefits with few studies estimating economic and social benefits; and (6) linkages between urban forests and their social-psychological and health effects are less common due to subjectivity and uncertainty in expressing and quantifying human cultures, attitudes and behaviors. Based on a comparison of different models and a syntheses of case studies, we make suggestions for future research connecting urban forestry and urban ecosystems, model development, and ecosystem services. Such knowledge is critical for policy- and decision-makers, and can help improve urban forest planning, design and management.},

  abstract = {Trees are known to provide various ecosystem services and disservices to urban communities, which can be quantified using models based on field and environmental data. It is often uncertain how tree structure and environmental variables impact model output. Here we perform a sensitivity analysis (SA) of i-Tree Eco, a common urban forest model, to analyze the relative impact of different model inputs on three module outputs: biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC)(isoprene and monoterpenes) emissions, carbon storage and sequestration, and dry deposition of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone. The SA methods included novel applications of the Morris one-at-a-time method and a variance-based decomposition method, which integrates Monte Carlo simulation with Latin hypercube sampling and Iman Conover analysis. A case study was performed in New York City, New York, USA, with field plot data collected in 2013. Genus has the largest influence on BVOC emissions by determining base emission rates and its high interactions with other input factors, and BVOC emissions are sensitive to leaf biomass in a concave manner and temperature in a convex manner, while isoprene emissions show a strong linear relationship with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Diameter at breast height plays the most important role for both carbon storage and sequestration estimators; crown light exposure and tree condition are also important for carbon sequestration. Dry deposition velocity is sensitive to leaf area index and relative humidity in a nearly linear way, while sensitive to temperature and PAR in a concave manner. The results provide guidance to facilitate future field plot campaigns and model development. The knowledge revealed by the SA is also beneficial for model uncertainty reduction, which in turn facilitates more effective urban forest management and decision-making.},

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Human disturbances are a major driver of biodiversity declines world-wide, and the intensely used Alberta forest landscape is no exception to this trend. Monitoring of such large areas is typically conducted via multi-temporal land-cover maps from remote sensing, but automated and efficient procedures for reliable, operational applica-tions have yet to be fully developed. In an effort to contribute to this need, we developed an innovative approach to landscape monitoring: the disturbance-inventory framework, which is applied for the first time as described here to monitor annual changes in an 8800-km 2 multi-use landscape in west-central Alberta, Canada. Using this framework, we (1) report on the spatio-temporal distribution of industrial disturbances such as harvesting cutblocks, oil and gas wells, coal mines, and road/pipelines; and (2) track the associated annual changes in land-cover composition and configuration between 1998 and 2005. To enable spatially explicit analyses within the study area, we divided it into 178, 49 km 2 -square landscape cells. The overall area-based annual rate of change of 0.62\% for this multi-use may be considered moderate compared to other regions, where change was mainly shaped by a single use, i.e., forestry. However, the spatially explicit nature of our analysis revealed that the eastern half of the study area is subject to considerably higher rates of change, mainly due to the concurrent appearance of disturbances from forestry and the oil and gas industry. The western half, by contrast, is more restricted by rugged terrain and fewer roads. The average distance to disturbance features across the entire study area decreased from 1500 m to 1200 m over the seven years. Total forest area, mean and largest patch size, and mean shape index all decreased consistently over the same period. The detected rapid change and associated fragmentation call for ongoing monitoring of this and other multi-use landscapes, which could be undertaken using this framework.},

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) populations across their range are being threatened by anthropogenic devel-opment and associated increases in human-caused mortality. However, details surrounding the impact of cumulative human effects are not yet fully understood, as prior research has focused primarily on habitat selection of individual disturbance features, rather than the spatio-temporal dynamics of aggregated dis-turbance processes. We used grizzly bear relative-abundance information from a DNA population inven-tory alongside a GIS database of human footprint dynamics to gain insight into the relationships between human disturbance features and the spatial distribution of grizzly bears in west-central Alberta, Canada: a landscape experiencing heavy resource development. We used candidate model-selection techniques and zero-inflated Poisson regression models to test competing hypotheses about disturbance processes, neighborhood effect and landscape characteristics. The best model explained about 57\% of the overall variation in relative grizzly bear abundance. Areas with lower 'disturbance exposure' (i.e. high mean dis-tance to new disturbances over time), lower 'neighborhood disturbance' (i.e. disturbance density around those areas), and higher 'availability of regenerating forest', were associated with higher bear abundance. In addition, areas located further away from an adjacent protected area exhibited a higher probability of 'excess absences', accounting indirectly for the cumulative effects of disturbance and the history of human-caused mortality. Our results suggest that managing the spatio-temporal exposure of grizzly bears to new disturbance features may be an important consideration for conserving this species in rap-idly changing landscapes.},

  abstract = {Urban expansion threatens global biodiversity through the destruction of natural and semi-natural habitats and increased levels of disturbance. Whilst woodlands in urban areas may reduce the impact of urbanisation on biodiversity, they are often subject to under or over-management and consist of small, fragmented patches which may be isolated. Effective management strategies for urban woodland require an understanding of the ecology and habitat requirements of all relevant taxa. Yet, little is known of how invertebrate, and in particular moth, assemblages utilise urban woodland despite being commonly found within the urban landscape. Here we show that the abundance, species richness, and species diversity of moth assemblages found within urban woodlands are determined by woodland vegetation character, patch configuration and the surrounding landscape. In general, mature broadleaved woodlands supported the highest abundance and diversity of moths. Large compact woodlands with proportionally less edge exposed to the surrounding matrix were associated with higher moth abundance than small complex woodlands. Woodland vegetation characteristics were more important than the surrounding landscape, suggesting that management at a local scale to ensure provision of good quality habitat may be relatively more important for moth populations than improving habitat connectivity across the urban matrix. Our results show that the planting of broadleaved woodlands, retaining mature trees and minimising woodland fragmentation will be bene- ficial for moth assemblages.},

Allozyme electrophoresis, as well as mitochondrial DNA and morphological analyses, were employed to delimit species boundaries and assess the population genetic structure of the ostracods from bromeliads on the island of Jamaica. Nine species from the genus Elpidium were both sexually reproducing and endemic to the island. The other commonly encountered ostracod genus, Candonopsis, was represented by at least two sexually reproducing species. Most Elpidium species showed very restricted distributions, low heterozygosity, and marked gene pool fragmentation, suggesting that population bottlenecks have occurred frequently. Whether founder events played a causal role in the diversification of these ostracods remains uncertain, but bromeliad habitats seem to be a source of high biodiversity, and may represent an ideal setting for extensive allopatric speciation},

  abstract = {A tradeoff between energy gain from foraging and safety from predation in refuges is a common situation for many herbivores that are vulnerable to predation while foraging. This tradeoff affects the population dynamics of the plant-herbivore-predator interaction. A new functional response is derived based on the Holling type 2 functional response and the assumption that the herbivore can forage at a rate that maximizes its fitness. The predation rate on the herbivore is assumed to be proportional to the product of the time that the herbivore spends foraging and a risk factor that reflects the habitat complexity; where greater complexity means greater interspersion of high food quality habitat and refuge habitat, which increases the amount of the edge zone between refuge and foraging areas, making foraging safer. The snowshoe hare is chosen as an example to demonstrate the resulting dynamics of an herbivore that has been intensely studied and that undergoes well-known cycling. Two models are studied in which the optimal foraging by hares is assumed, a vegetation-hare-generalist predator model and a vegetation hare specialist predator model. In both cases, the results suggest that the cycling of the snowshoe hare population will be greatly moderated by optimal foraging in a habitat consisting of interspersed high quality foraging habitat and refuge habitat. However, there are also large differences in the dynamics produced by the two models as a function of pre-dation pressure.},

  abstract = {Many environmental challenges are exacerbated within the urban landscape, such as stormwater runoff and flood risk, chemical and particulate pollution of urban air, soil and water, the urban heat island, and summer heat waves. Urban trees, and the urban forest as a whole, can be managed to have an impact on the urban water, heat, carbon and pollution cycles. However, there is an increasing need for empirical evidence as to the magnitude of the impacts, both beneficial and adverse, that urban trees can provide and the role that climatic region and built landscape circumstance play in modifying those impacts. This special section presents new research that advances our knowledge of the ecological and environmental services provided by the urban forest. The 14 studies included provide a global perspective on the role of trees in towns and cities from five continents. Some studies provide evidence for the cooling benefit of the local microclimate in urban green space with and without trees. Other studies focus solely on the cooling benefit of urban tree transpiration at a mesoscale or on cooling from canopy shade at a street and pedestrian scale. Other studies are concerned with tree species differences in canopy interception of rainfall, water uptake from biofilter systems, and water quality improvements through nutrient uptake from stormwater runoff. Research reported here also considers both the positive and the negative impacts of trees on air quality, through the role of trees in removing air pollutants such as ozone as well as in releasing potentially harmful volatile organic compounds and allergenic particulates. A transdisciplinary framework to support future urban forest research is proposed to better understand and communicate the role of urban trees in urban biogeochemical cycles that are highly disturbed, highly managed, and of paramount importance to human health and well-being. Core Ideas The urban forest can be managed to impact the urban water, heat, carbon, and pollution cycles. An evidence base is needed for the ecosystem service benefit urban trees can provide.

Since only methylmercury (MeHg) bioaccumulates in food chains, sources of MeHg need to be identified. Recently, wetlands in the High Arctic were found to produce MeHg, and this was confirmed in laboratory soil incubations. In the present study both wetlands and snowmelt water were evaluated as sources of MeHg to Arctic ecosystems in Nunavut. Three substudies took place on Cornwallis Island, and one took place on Ellesmere Island. First, the effect of wetland presence in lake watersheds was evaluated by comparing four lakes with wetlands present to four lakes without wetlands present. Next, two individual wetlands were spatially and temporally investigated. Finally, three basin tributaries were evaluated for snowmelt MeHg sources. Catchments on Cornwallis Island with wetlands did not have an observable effect on MeHg levels in downstream lake water, but the wetland on Ellesmere Island contributed significant MeHg. In contrast, calculated yields of MeHg in tributaries draining snowmelt on Cornwallis Island were higher (ca. 1.5 mg km(-2) day(-1)) than those measured in temperate catchments characterized by wetlands. Methylmercury and total Hg concentrations in lakes, wetlands, and basin tributaries showed a strong temporal trend that corresponded to inputs from snowmelt water in late spring. This study revealed that wetland export of MeHg to downstream Arctic lakes is site dependent, and snowmelt water was the most significant source of MeHg to Arctic ecosystems located on Cornwallis Island.},

This limits our knowledge of population trends in other major groups of amphibians, including stream sala-manders, which have their greatest diversity in North America. I hypothesized that increasing air temper-ature and precipitation in northeastern North America caused abundance of the stream salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus in a New Hampshire population to decline between 1999 and 2010. I found a significant decline in abundance of G. porphyriticus adults over this 12-year period, and no trend in lar-val abundance. Adult abundance was negatively related to annual precipitation, which is predicted to increase further in the Northeast due to climate change. Analysis of a 6-year capture\textendash mark\textendash recapture data set for the same population showed no temporal variation in larval and adult detectability, validat-ing the abundance data, and no variation in larval and adult survival. However, survival during metamor-phosis from the larval to adult stage declined dramatically. These results suggest that increasing precipitation is causing a decline in adult recruitment, which, if it persists, will lead to local extinction. A likely mechanism for the decline in adult recruitment is mortality of metamorphosing individuals dur-ing spring and fall floods, which have increased in volume and frequency with the increase in precipita-tion. More broadly, this study presents strong evidence that the amphibian decline crisis extends to North America's stream salamanders, and shows the critical need to collect population data on these species.},

Quantitative approaches to predator-prey interactions are central to understanding the structure of food webs and their dynamics. Different predatory strategies may influence the occurrence and strength of trophic interactions likely affecting the rates and magnitudes of energy and nutrient transfer between trophic levels and stoichiometry of predator-prey interactions. Here, we used spider-prey interactions as a model system to investigate whether different spider web architectures-orb, tangle, and sheet-tangle-affect the composition and diet breadth of spiders and whether these, in turn, influence stoichiometric relationships between spiders and their prey. Our results showed that web architecture partially affects the richness and composition of the prey captured by spiders. Tangle-web spiders were specialists, capturing a restricted subset of the prey community (primarily Diptera), whereas orb and sheet-tangle web spiders were generalists, capturing a broader range of prey types. We also observed elemental imbalances between spiders and their prey. In general, spiders had higher requirements for both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) than those provided by their prey even after accounting for prey biomass. Larger P imbalances for tangle-web spiders than for orb and sheet-tangle web spiders suggest that trophic specialization may impose strong elemental constraints for these predators unless they display behavioral or physiological mechanisms to cope with nutrient limitation. Our findings suggest that integrating quantitative analysis of species interactions with elemental stoichiometry can help to better understand the occurrence of stoichiometric imbalances in predator-prey interactions.},

  abstract = {Planning and managing urban forests for livable cities remains a challenge worldwide owing to sparse infor\- mation on the spatial distribution, structure and composition of urban trees and forests. National and municipal sources of tree inventory remain limited due to a lack of detailed, consistent and frequent inventory assessments. Despite advancements in research on the automation of urban tree mapping using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) or high-resolution satellite imagery, in practice most municipalities still perform labor-intensive field surveys to collect and update tree inventories. We present a robust, affordable and rapid method for creating tree inventories in any urban region where sufficient street-level imagery is readily available. Our approach is novel in that we use a Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) to detect and locate separate tree instances from street-level imagery, thereby successfully creating shape masks around unique fuzzy urban objects like trees. The novelty of this method is enhanced by using monocular depth estimation and triangulation to estimate precise tree location, relying only on photographs and images taken from the street. Experiments across four cities show that our method is transferable to different image sources (Google Street View, Mapillary) and urban ecosystems. We successfully detect {$>$}70\% of all public and private trees recorded in a ground-truth campaign across Metro Vancouver. The accuracy of geolocation is also promising. We automatically locate public and private trees with a mean error in the absolute position ranging from 4 to 6 m, which is comparable to ground-truth measurements in conventional manual urban tree inventory campaigns.},

  abstract = {There is a close parallel between the development of theories in economics and population biology. In biology, however, the geometry of the organisms and their environment plays a greater role. Different phenotypes have different abilities at harvesting resources, and the resources are distributed in a patchwork in three dimensions of the environment. In this paper we undertake to determine in which patches a species would feed and which items would form its diet if the species acted in the most economical fashion. Hopefully, natural selection will often have achieved such optimal allocation of time and energy expenditures, but such "optimum theories" are hypotheses for testing rather than anything certain. Some aspects of dietary and patch utilization have been treated in rather different ways by Hutchinson and MacArthur (1959) and by MacArthur and Levins (1964). The best empirical support for the model to be presented is that given by McNab (1963). The basic procedure for determining optimal utilization of time or energy budgets is very simple: an activity should be enlarged as long as the resulting gain in time spent per unit food exceeds the loss. When any further enlargement would entail a greater loss than gain no such enlargement should take place. The problem is to find which components of a time or energy budget increase and which decrease as certain activities are enlarged. Consider, first, the optimal number of kinds of items (such as prey species) in the diet. We assume here that the environment is "tfine-grained," that is, that during search for food the prey species are located in the proportion in which they occur. In a later paragraph we deal with patchy environments where this is not true. We divide the time spent, per item eaten, into two components: time for search, and time for pursuit capture and eating. (The difference is that the animal searches a fine grained environment for all kinds of items simultaneously but pursues captures and eats them one at a time.) Suppose that the predator already includes N kinds of prey in its diet. Then we may subdivide its time, TN, per item eaten, into a search time TNS and a pursuit (plus capture and eating) time, TNP. We can do the same for the predator if he were to enlarge his diet to include N + 1 kinds of prey. Writing both down in symbols T T S +T P) TN+1= TN+1 +TN+1 TN = TNS + TNP (all times are per item of food). A TN =A TNS + A TNP 603},

They are microbially active and conducive to methylation of inorganic mercury, and are also affected by Arctic warming. This multiyear study investigated thaw ponds in a discontinuous permafrost region in the Subarctic taiga (Kuujjuarapik-Whapmagoostui, QC) and a continuous permafrost region in the Arctic tundra (Bylot Island, NU). MeHg concentrations in thaw ponds were well above levels measured in most freshwater ecosystems in the Canadian Arctic ({$>$}0.1 ng L(-1)). On Bylot, ice-wedge trough ponds showed significantly higher MeHg (0.3-2.2 ng L(-1)) than polygonal ponds (0.1-0.3 ng L(-1)) or lakes ({$<$}0.1 ng L(-1)). High MeHg was measured in the bottom waters of Subarctic thaw ponds near Kuujjuarapik (0.1-3.1 ng L(-1)). High water MeHg concentrations in thaw ponds were strongly correlated with variables associated with high inputs of organic matter (DOC, a320, Fe), nutrients (TP, TN), and microbial activity (dissolved CO2 and CH4). Thawing permafrost due to Arctic warming will continue to release nutrients and organic carbon into these systems and increase ponding in some regions, likely stimulating higher water concentrations of MeHg. Greater hydrological connectivity from permafrost thawing may potentially increase transport of MeHg from thaw ponds to neighboring aquatic ecosystems.},

The distributions of these species were best explained by water colour and latitude, although alkalinity and total phosphorus also appeared to be important explanatory factors. Contrary to our original hypothesis, summer water temperatures had a negligible impact on the distribu-tion of dominants, although, due to the restricted summer season we examined, only a limited temper-ature gradient was present in the dataset. Cryptophytes occurred more frequently among dominants in North-ern Europe whereas cyanobacteria and dinophytes dominated more in Central and Southern Europe. Our analyses suggest that besides nutrient concentrations, other water chemistry variables, such as alkalinity and the content of humic substances, have at least as important a role in determining the distribution of the dominant phytoplankton species in European lakes.},

The sanctuary was explored for species richness and diversity of butterflies. A six-month-long study revealed the occurrence of 59 butterfly species that included 21 unique species and 9 species listed in the threatened category. The mixed moist deciduous mature forest of the sanctuary harbored greater species richness and species diversity (39 species under 31 genera) than other parts of the sanctuary, which is comprised of regenerated secondary mixed deciduous forest (37 species under 32 genera), degraded forests (32 species under 28 genera), and open grassland with patches of plantations and artificial lakes (24 species under 17 genera). The majority of these species showed a distribution range throughout the Indo-Malayan region and Australasia tropics, and eight species were distributed in the eastern parts of South Asia, including one species, Labadea martha (F.), which is distributed in the eastern Himalayas alone. Estimator Chao 2 provided the best-predicted value of species richness. The steep slope of the species accumulation curve suggested the occurrence of a large number of rare species, and a prolonged gentle slope suggested a higher species richness at a higher sample abundance.

It has been widely shown that food or resource levels are important in the selection of habitats. Other studies have shown the importance of cover as safe areas to decrease predation risk indicating the role of cover in habitat selection. With regards to lagomorphs, no studies have characterized vegetation cover and resource levels simultaneously. This study tested whether black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus), as predicted by optimal foraging theory, consider resource and predation risk levels in their habitat selection. We conducted our study in grassland and shrubland habitats in the Chihuahuan desert to test the following predictions: (1) in habitats with equal levels of predation risk, areas used more by jackrabbits will have higher resource levels; (2) between habitats with different levels of predation risk, the higher used low risk area will have lower resource levels. To test these predictions, we measured and compared the quantity of grass/ forb species between a high use, low risk grassland and a low use, high risk shrubland and in areas of high and low jackrabbit use within these two habitats. We found less forbs and grasses in the high use grassland (linear density index (LDI)=48.1712.4 ind., grassland vs. 63.379.9 ind., shrubland, F1;27 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 19:1; pp0:005)). Inside habitats we found more forbs and grasses in the high use than the low use areas (LDI=83.1711.4 ind., high use vs. 30.475.2 ind., low use, F1;27 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 177:7; pp0:001). These results supported our predictions and we concluded that optimal foraging theory helps explain habitat use by black-tailed jackrabbits in the Chihuahuan desert.},

  abstract = {1. Drought induces changes in the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycle but most plant species have limited flexibility to take up nutrients under such variable or unbalanced N and P availability. Both the degree of flexibility in plant N:P ratio and of root symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi might control plant resistance to drought-induced changes in nutrient availability, but this has not been directly tested. 2. Here, we examined the role of plant N:P stoichiometric status and mycorrhizal symbiosis in the drought-resistance of dominant and subordinate species in a semi-natural grassland. 3. We reduced water availability using rainout shelters (control vs. drought) and measured how plant biomass responded for the dominant and subordinate species. We then selected a dominant (Paspalum dilatatum) and a subordinate species (Cynodon dactylon), for which we investigated the N:P stoichiometric status, mycorrhizal root colonization and water-use efficiency. 4. The biomass of all dominant plant species, but not subordinate species, decreased under drought. Drought increased soil available nitrogen, and thus increased soil N:P ratio, due to decreasing plant N uptake. The dominant P. dilatatum showed a high degree of plant N:P homeostasis and a considerable reduction in biomass under drought. At the opposite, the more flexible subordinate species C. dactylon increased its N uptake and water-use efficiency, apparently due to stronger symbiosis with mycorrhizae, and maintained its biomass. 5. Synthesis. We conclude that the maintenance of N:P homeostasis in dominant species, possibly because of a large root nutrient foraging capacity, becomes inefficient when water stress limits N mobility in the soil. By contrast, we demonstrate that higher stoichiometric N:P flexibility coupled with stronger mutualistic association with mycorrhizae allow subordinate species to better withstand drought perturbations. Using a stoichiometric approach in a field experiment, our study provides for the first time clear and novel understandings of the mechanisms involved in drought-resistance within the plant-mycorrhizae-soil system.},

This stoichiometry, referred to as the Redfield ratio, continues to be a central tenet in ocean biogeochemistry, and is used to infer a variety of ecosystem processes, such as phytoplankton productivity and rates of nitrogen fixation and loss 2-4. Model, field and laboratory studies have shown that different mechanisms can explain both constant and variable ratios of carbon to nitrogen and phosphorus among ocean plankton communities. The range of C/N/P ratios in the ocean, and their predictability, are the subject of much active research 5-12. Here we assess global patterns in the elemental composition of phytoplankton and particulate organic matter in the upper ocean, using published and unpublished observations of particulate phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon from a broad latitudinal range, supplemented with elemental data for surface plankton populations. We show that the elemental ratios of marine organic matter exhibit large spatial variations, with a global average that differs substantially from the canonical Redfield ratio. However, elemental ratios exhibit a clear latitudinal trend. Specifically, we observed a ratio of 195:28:1 in the warm nutrient-depleted low-latitude gyres, 137:18:1 in warm, nutrient-rich upwelling zones, and 78:13:1 in cold, nutrient-rich high-latitude regions. We suggest that the coupling between oceanic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles may vary systematically by ecosystem. A. C. Redfield first noted the similarity between the particulate nutrient ratios of plankton living in the surface ocean and that of dissolved nutrients in the deep ocean 1. He predicted that deep-ocean nutrient ratios were controlled by the uniform nutrient requirements of sinking, and subsequently remineralized, surface plankton. This concept remains a central tenet in our understanding of ocean biogeochemistry. However, model, field and laboratory studies have shown that different mechanisms can explain both constant and variable C/N/P ratios among ocean plankton communities, but the range of ratios in the ocean and the relative importance of each mechanism are subject to much research 5-10,13,14. Despite this continued lack of understanding of global patterns, the N/P ratio is routinely used to draw conclusions about ocean ecosystem processes, particularly related to nutrient limitation of phytoplankton production and the net magnitude of N 2 fixation and denitrification. 2,3. Alas, these ratios are of critical importance to study, model and predict ocean biogeochemical cycles. Equally important is the C/P ratio of ocean plankton},

Currently, popular methods to quantify landscape connectivity emphasize how landscape features provide resistance to movement. While many tools are available to quantify landscape resistance, these do not discern between two fundamentally different sources of resistance: movement behavior and mortality. To address this issue, we developed the samc R package that quantifies landscape connectivity using absorbing Markov chain theory. Within this mathematical framework, movements are represented as transient states in the Markov chain, while mortality is represented by transitions to absorbing states. Not only does this framework explicitly account for these different issues, it provides a probabilistic approach that can incorporate both short-term and long-term dynamics, as well as species distribution and abundance. The package includes functions to quantify life expectancy, long-term visitation rates, and various spatially and temporally explicit measures of mortality and movement at the local and landscape scales. These functions in samc have been optimized to find computationally practical solutions in landscapes comprised of {$>$} 2 \texttimes{} 106 cells. Here, we illustrate the workflow of the samc package with publicly available movement and mortality data on the endangered Florida panther Puma concolor coryi. This analysis showed that movement and mortality are generally correlated except for locations near roads (areas of high mortality risk) that are within the dispersal range of source locations. This pattern would have been undetectable with current methods that quantify movement resistance. Overall, the samc package provides a means for implementing spatial absorbing Markov chains that can distinguish between movement behavior and mortality resulting in more reliable landscape connectivity measures.},

Populations may suffer rapid declines from the introduction of new stressors, but how demography changes over time is critical to determining long-term outcomes for populations. White-nose syndrome (WNS), an infectious disease of hibernating bats, has caused massive and rapid population declines in several hibernating species of bats in North America since the disease was first observed on the continent in 2006. Estimating annual survival rates and demographic trends among remnant colonies of hibernating bats that experienced mass mortality from WNS is needed to determine long-term population viability of species impacted by this disease.

Much of this can be attributed to diver-gent public values, but the narrow perceptions and incomplete and fragmented problem definitions of those involved have exacerbated an inherently difficult situation. We present a conceptual model that extends the traditional description of the grizzly bear conservation system to include facets of the human domain such as the behavior of managers, elected officials, and the public. The modelfocuses on human-caused mortality, the key determinant of grizzly bear population growth in this region and the interactions and feedback loops among humans that have a major potential influence on bear mortality. We also briefly evaluate existing in-formation and technical methods relevant to understanding this complex human-biophysical system. We ob-serve not only that the extant knowledge is insufficient for prediction (and in some cases for description), but also that traditional positivistic science alone is not adequate for dealing with the problems of grizzly bear conservation. We recommend changes in science and management that could improve learning and responsiveness among the involved individuals and organizations, clarify some existing uncertainty, and thereby increase the effectiveness of grizzly bear conservation and management. Although adaptive management is a promising approach, we point out some key-as yet unfulfilled-contingencies for implementation of a method such as this one that relies upon social processes and structures that promote open learning and flexibility in all facets of the policy process.},

Here, we compare summer dietary nitrogen availability of the five major browse plants (comprising {$\sim$}79\% of the diet) of moose (Alces alces) in Denali National Park and Nelchina Basin, Alaska, USA. In recent years the productivity of Denali moose has been significantly higher than that of Nelchina moose, prompting this comparison. We examined the phenological progression of leaf nitrogen concentration, tannin\textendash protein precipitation capacity, and digestible protein over three summers in both regions. We then modeled the potential nutritional consequences for a cow moose consuming representative diets on each range, predicting both net protein intake (NPI) and lean body mass accumulation each year. We found that leaf nitrogen and digestible protein decreased, while tannin\textendash protein precipitation capacity increased throughout the summer for all forages. There was 23\% more digestible protein in Denali leaves than Nelchina leaves on average, and this difference was significant in all three years. Tannins accounted for a large (mean = 46\%) reduction in protein availability, suggesting a key role of these secondary compounds in the nitrogen balance of moose in these regions. Finally, our NPI model predicted that Denali cows were in positive protein balance 17 days longer than Nelchina cows and accumulated 18 kg more lean body mass over the summer, on average. We conclude that summer dietary nitrogen availability may act as a nutritional constraint on moose and suggest that more emphasis be placed on elucidating its role in population dynamics and conservation of northern ungulates.},

High toxin concentration in leaves and fruits inhibits consumption, while predation risk reduces feeding opportunities, as prey forage to avoid encountering predators. Thus, both factors vary and define the quality of the landscape. How foraging animals directly quantify, compare and respond to these two costs has rarely been tested. 2. We show that free-ranging bushbabies \textendash{} small, frugivorous primates \textendash{} change their behaviour and use of artificial food patches based on the interplay between toxin concentration in food and patch safety. Using a titration experiment, we demonstrate that bushbabies quantify the relative costs of toxin and fear.We pinpoint where these costs are equivalent and show that animals seek food patches with the lower net cost. 3. We conclude that the ecological effectiveness of plant toxins as defence against consumers needs to be considered in the context of a landscape of fear \textendash{} and the relative impact of anti- predator tactics and plant defence is strongly shaped by the concentration of these defences. 4. A corollary is that plants may benefit from fear as a substitute for their own chemical defence, adding a new dimension to the concept of indirect plant defence.Whether, from the plant's per- spective, the benefits derived from fear can be considered evolutionarily adaptive rather than simply ecologically serendipitous remains to be tested.},

  abstract = {Despite the importance of community-structuring processes operating at both local and regional scales, there is relatively little work examining both forces within a single system. I used a combination of observational and experimental approaches to examine the processes structuring larval dragonfly distributions in lentic habitats that encompass a gradient of both permanence and top predator type. I compared the relative vulnerability of species to predators from different portions of this gradient to assess the role of predation as a local force structuring communities. I also assessed the role of regional processes on species' distributions by examining species' propensity to disperse to and colonize artificial ponds distributed across a landscape. In both studies I contrasted habitat specialist species, which had larvae restricted to permanent lakes, with habitat generalist species, which had larvae that occur broadly across the habitat permanence and top predator transition. Results from this work suggest that dispersal and colonization behavior were critical mechanisms restricting the distributions of habitat specialist species, but that predation may act to reinforce this pattern. The habitat specialists dispersed less frequently, colonized artificial ponds less often when they did reach them, and most moved shorter distances than the habitat generalist species. Habitat specialists were also more vulnerable than habitat generalists to an invertebrate top predator with which they do not co-exist. Results from these studies suggest that species distributions can be shaped by processes operating at both regional and local spatial scales. The role of dispersal and recruitment limitation may be generally underestimated as a force shaping species distributions and community structure across habitat gradients in which there is a transition in both the biotic interactions and the disturbance interval across that gradient.},

  abstract = {Species' range sizes are shaped by fundamental differences in species' ecological and evolutionary characteristics, and understanding the mechanisms determining range size can shed light on the factors responsible for generating and structuring biological diversity. Moreover, because geographic range size is associated with a species' risk of extinction and their ability to respond to global changes in climate and land use, understanding these mechanisms has important conservation implications. Despite the hypotheses that dispersal behaviour is a strong determinant of species range areas, few data are available to directly compare the relationship between dispersal behaviour and range size. Here, we overcome this limitation by combining data from a multispecies dispersal experiment with additional species-level trait data that are commonly hypothesized to affect range size (e.g. niche breadth, local abundance and body size.). This enables us to examine the relationship between these species-level traits and range size across North America for fifteen dragonfly species. Ten models based on a priori predictions about the relationship between species traits and range size were evaluated and two models were identified as good predictors of species range size. These models indicated that only two species' level traits, dispersal behaviour and niche breadth were strongly related to range size. The evidence from these two models indicated that dragonfly species that disperse more often and further had larger North American ranges. Extinction and colonization dynamics are expected to be a key linkage between dispersal behaviour and range size in dragonflies. To evaluate how extinction and colonization dynamics among dragonflies were related to range size we used an independent data set of extinction and colonization rates for eleven dragonfly species and assessed the relationship between these populations rates and North American range areas for these species. We found a negative relationship between North American range size and species' extinction-to-colonization ratios. Our results indicate that metapopulation dynamics act to shape the extent of species' continental distributions. These population dynamics are likely to interact with dispersal behaviour, particularly at species range margins, to determine range limits and ultimately species range sizes.},

We used data from three captive inoculation experiments involving 181 little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) to compare histopathology, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and ultraviolet fluorescence as diagnostic methods of P. destructans infection. To assess disease severity, we considered two histology metrics (wing area with fungal hyphae, area of dermal necrosis), P. destructans fungal load (qPCR), ultraviolet fluorescence, and blood chemistry (hematocrit, sodium, glucose, pCO2, and bicarbonate). Quantitative PCR was most effective for early detection of P. destructans, while all three methods were comparable in severe infections. Correlations among hyphae and necrosis scores, qPCR, ultraviolet fluorescence, blood chemistry, and hibernation duration indicate a multi-stage pattern of disease. Disruptions of homeostasis occurred rapidly in late hibernation. Our results provide valuable information about the use of non-destructive techniques for monitoring, and provide novel insight into the pathophysiology of white-nose syndrome, with implications for developing and implementing potential mitigation strategies.},

  abstract = {When measured by extent and intensity, urbanization is one of the most homogenizing of all major human activities. Cities homogenize the physical environment because they are built to meet the relatively narrow needs of just one species, our own. Also, cities are maintained for centuries in a disequilibrium state from the local natural environment by the importation of vast resources of energy and materials. Consequently, as cities expand across the planet, biological homogenization increases because the same "urban-adaptable" species become increasingly widespread and locally abundant in cities across the planet. As urbanization often produces a local gradient of disturbance, one can also observe a gradient of homogenization. Synanthropic species adapted to intensely modified built habitats at the urban core are "global homogenizers", found in cities worldwide. However, many suburban and urban fringe habitats are occupied by native species that become regionally widespread. These suburban adapters typically consist of early successional plants and "edge" animal species such as mesopredator mammals, and ground-foraging, omnivorous and frugivorous birds that can utilize gardens, forest fragments and many other habitats available in the suburbs. A basic conservation challenge is that urban biota is often quite diverse and very abundant. The intentional and unintentional importation of species adapted to urban habitats, combined with many food resources imported for human use, often produces local species diversity and abundance that is often equal to or greater than the surrounding landscape. With the important exception of low-income areas, urban human populations often inhabit richly cultivated suburban habitats with a relatively high local floral and faunal diversity and/or abundance without awareness of the global impoverishment caused by urbanization. Equally challenging is that, because so many urban species are immigrants adapting to city habitats, urbanites of all income levels become increasingly disconnected from local indigenous species and their natural ecosystems. Urban conservation should therefore focus on promoting preservation and restoration of local indigenous species.},

Suppression increases with increasing canopy cover and forest age. However, response to an individual, severe browsing episode cannot be generalized in terms of suppression. Such shorter-term responses are best investigated by experimentation. Artificial removal of foliage from understory balsam fir in two sites on Isle Royale and one mainland site showed that damage such as reduced terminal growth and complete mortality was actually highest among least suppressed trees. Canopy cover produced a secondary effect, in which trees experiencing {$>$}60\% cover were unable to compensate for removal by clipping. Among less suppressed trees, competition for limited light produced an apically oriented morphology that countered the laterally oriented morphology associated with suppression. Higher vulnerability to the artificial browsing occurred because trees were no longer protected by snow cover. By the second growing season following clipping, surviving clipped trees even in the most damaged sites resumed the same growth as controls. Over the long term, suppression may be a means by which fir remains alive when subjected to continuous browsing. Over the shorter term, delayed growth recovery following severe browsing in an unsuppressed understory may also contribute to sustainability in Isle Royale's plant-herbivore system.},

A survey of t\'ungara frog calling sites revealed that frog abundance was not significantly correlated with urbanization, light, noise, or temperature. In contrast, frog-biting midges were sensitive to light pollution and noise pollution. Increased light intensity significantly reduced midge abundance at low noise levels. At high noise intensity, there were no midges regardless of light level. Two field experiments controlling light and noise levels to examine attraction of the midges to their host and their feeding behavior confirmed the causality of these field patterns.

  volume = {97},
  abstract = {All animals are limited in the extent of their daily wanderings. This is notably true of mammals, for which many estimates of home range exist. It is obvious that the size of a mammal will greatly affect the maximum area that can be covered and, therefore, will influence the size of the home range. But body size has another, independent influence: larger species must collect more energy to supply their requirements than small species. Generally, a large energy demand will necessitate a large area for food gathering, unless the food exists in superabundance. Many other considerations may also alter the size of the home range (Brown, 1962), but the object of this paper is to examine only the relation between the size of home range and body size, since body size would appear at first glance to be the most important factor in the determination of home range size. DATA Data from mammals are used in this paper, since this group has had the most active attention, both in terms of estimates of home range size and in measurements of body weight (which is used in this study to indicate body size). The data that form the basis for this analysis were principally taken from Burt (1948) and Fitch (1958), but were supplemented by data from Mohr (1947), Blair (1951), Calhoun and Casby (1958), and Ingles (1961). These papers do not represent a complete survey of the literature, but they contain much of the data on the smaller species of mammals. The methods used for the estimation of home range size vary greatly, and, more importantly, give different results, as was pointed out by Mohr (1947), Hayne (1949), Calhoun and Casby (1958), Fitch (1958), and Brown (1962). I shall not enter into a discussion of the limitations of the methods; nevertheless , when comparisons are made between the results of different methods (Mohr, 1947), the individual estimates for one species are usually of the same order of magnitude so that the errors involved are probably relatively small over a wide range in body weight. The values for home range are in acres and those for body weight are in kilograms (table 1). 133},

However, the field is heterogeneous as a global inquiry with multiple theoretical and conceptual frameworks, variable research approaches, and a lack of coordination among multiple schools of thought and research foci. Here, we present an international consensus on how urban ecology can advance along multiple research directions. There is potential for the field to mature as a holistic, integrated science of urban systems. Such an integrated science could better inform decisionmakers who need increased understanding of complex relationships among social, ecological, economic, and built infrastructure systems. To advance the field requires conceptual synthesis, knowledge and data sharing, cross-city comparative research, new intellectual networks, and engagement with additional disciplines. We consider challenges and opportunities for understanding dynamics of urban systems. We suggest pathways for advancing urban ecology research to support the goals of improving urban sustainability and resilience, conserving urban biodiversity, and promoting human well-being on an urbanizing planet.},

When natural or human factors degrade wetlands, ecological restoration is often carried out to recover biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES). Although such restorations are routinely performed, we lack systematic, evidence-based assessments of their effectiveness on the recovery of biodiversity and ES. Here we performed a meta-analysis of 70 experimental studies in order to assess the effectiveness of ecological restoration and identify what factors affect it. We compared selected ecosystem performance variables between degraded and restored wetlands and between restored and natural wetlands using response ratios and random-effects categorical modeling. We assessed how context factors such as ecosystem type, main agent of degradation, restoration action, experimental design, and restoration age influenced post-restoration biodiversity and ES. Biodiversity showed excellent recovery, though the precise recovery depended strongly on the type of organisms involved. Restored wetlands showed 36\% higher levels of provisioning, regulating and supporting ES than did degraded wetlands. In fact, wetlands showed levels of provisioning and cultural ES similar to those of natural wetlands; however, their levels of supporting and regulating ES were, respectively, 16\% and 22\% lower than in natural wetlands. Recovery of biodiversity and of ES were positively correlated, indicating a win-win restoration outcome. The extent to which restoration increased biodiversity and ES in degraded wetlands depended primarily on the main agent of degradation, restoration actions, experimental design, and ecosystem type. In contrast, the choice of specific restoration actions alone explained most differences between restored and natural wetlands. These results highlight the importance of comprehensive, multi-factorial assessment to determine the ecological status of degraded, restored and natural wetlands and thereby evaluate the effectiveness of ecological restorations. Future research on wetland restoration should also seek to identify which restoration actions work best for specific habitats.},

We have quantified these effects in a large, long-term (7-y) soil-warming study in a deciduous forest in New England. Soil warming has resulted in carbon losses from the soil and stimulated carbon gains in the woody tissue of trees. The warming-enhanced decay of soil organic matter also released enough additional inorganic nitrogen into the soil solution to support the observed increases in plant carbon storage. Although soil warming has resulted in a cumulative net loss of carbon from a New England forest relative to a control area over the 7-y study, the annual net losses generally decreased over time as plant carbon storage increased. In the seventh year, warming-induced soil carbon losses were almost totally compensated for by plant carbon gains in response to warming. We attribute the plant gains primarily to warming-induced increases in nitrogen availability. This study underscores the importance of incorporating carbon-nitrogen interactions in atmosphere-ocean-land earth system models to accurately simulate land feedbacks to the climate system. climate system feedbacks | ecological stoichiometry | forest carbon budget | forest nitrogen budget | global climate change},

Here, we tested the hypothesis that copepods of the species Acartia tonsa select prey cells based on quality differences within prey species. We assessed age-specific variation in feeding behaviour and evaluated the potential consequences of such variation for nutrient cycles. Nauplii (young) stages characterized by a low nitrogen to phosphorus (N:P) ratio in their body tissue selected for phosphorus-rich food, while older copepodite stages with higher body N:P selected for nitrogen-rich food. Further, the analysis of a 35-year data set in the southern North Sea revealed a positive correlation between the abundance of nauplii and the ratio of dissolved inorganic N:P, thus suggesting that P-availability for primary producers declines with the population densities of nauplii. Our findings demonstrate that a combination of stage-specific selective feeding and body stoichiometry has the potential to affect cycling of limiting nutrients when consumer populations change in composition.},

  abstract = {The choice of predator foraging mode has important consequences for ecological communities. Foraging mode designations are often made on the basis of predator activity, yet activity can be affected by various environmental stimuli independent of changes in foraging mode. Structural complexity can reduce predator activity by either interfering with predator vision and mobility or as part of a foraging mode shift. We examined the effects of simulated aquatic vegetation on multiple behaviors of 2 aquatic insect predators to distinguish between these 2 possible outcomes. Larvae of the diving water beetle (Dytiscus spp.) shifted from an active predator in treatments without structure to a sit-and-pursue (SAP) predator in treatments containing structure, as indicated by a decrease in activity and prey encounter rates and an increase in probability of capture. This trade-off between encounter rates and probability of capture resulted in an equal number of prey captures among the treatments. Dragonfly nymphs (Anax junius) remained SAP predators in both treatments, although interference from the simulated vegetation significantly reduced activity. Structure also slightly decreased the number of aeshnid prey captures. Physiological attributes of the predators, such as mode of respiration and method of prey detection, seemed to influence foraging behavior. This study emphasizes the benefits of measuring multiple predator behaviors when classifying predators to particular foraging modes.},

One of the most effective means of evaluating the effects of anthropogenic disturbance in aquatic ecosystems is the use of bioindicators, and the insects of the order Odonata are among the most efficient indicators, due to their enormous sensitivity to environmental changes. In this context, the present study aimed to verify which parameters of the odonate community (species richness, abundance/biomass, composition, taxonomic diversity and taxonomic/phylogenetic distinctness) are most effective for the evaluation of the loss of environmental integrity. The study focused on 50 streams in the northeast of the Brazilian state of Par\'a. The streams were sampled during the dry season, between June and August 2011. The physical characteristics of each stream were evaluated using a Habitat Integrity Index (HII). The species composition provided the best parameter for the evaluation of ecological integrity, providing a relatively accurate assessment at a lower mean research cost than other parameters. Taxonomic diversity and distinctness also provided relatively reliable results, contributed additional information on the evolutionary relationships among the odonate taxa, and also provided a low-cost approach. Deconstructing communities is necessary to detect impacts, considering the considerable variation in the environmental requirements of the different species. Overall, the parameter that best responded to gradients of disturbance was species composition, followed by diversity and taxonomic distinctness. Given these findings, odonate-based biomonitoring should focus on these parameters to guarantee the optimal detection and evaluation of habitat alterations.},

We present alternative approaches to the analysis of resource selection based on the utilization distribution (UD). Our objectives are to describe the rationale for estimation of RSFs based on UDs. offer advice about computing UDs and RSFs, and illustrate their use in resource selection studies. We discuss the 3 main factors that should be considered when using kemel UD-based estimates of space use: selection of bandwidth values, sample size versus precision of estimates, and UD shape and complexity. We present 3 case studies fhaf demonstrate use of UDs in resource selection modeling. The first example demonstrates the general case of RSF estimation that uses multiple regression adjusted for spatial autocorrelation to relate UD estimates (i.e., the probability density function) to resource attributes. A second example, involving Poisson regression with an offset term, is presented as an altemative for modeling the relative frequency, or probability of use. within defined habitat units. This procedure uses the relative frequency of locations within a habitat unit as a surrogate of the UD and requires relatively fewer user- defined options in the modeling of resource selection. Last, we illustrate how the UD can also be used to enhance univahate resource selection analyses, such as compositional analysis, in cases where animals use their range nonrandamly. The UD helps overcome several common shortcomings of some other analytical techniques by treating the animal as the primary sampling unit, summarizing use in a continuous and probabilistic manner, and relying on the pattem of animal space use rather than using individual sampling points. However, several drawbacks are apparent when using the UD in resource selection analyses. Choice of UD estimator is important and sensitive to sample size and user- defined options, such as bandwidth and software selection. Extensions to these procedures could consider behavioral-based approaches and altemative techniques to estimate the UD directly},

Extensive studies mostly developed in west North America have shown a large negative effect of these introductions on amphibians, although no extensive studies are available from other continents such as Europe. Fish were also introduced extensively in the Pyrenees (southern Europe), mainly trout for angling and minnows for their use as live bait for fishing trout. We studied the effect of non-native trout and minnows on the occurrence of amphibian species inhabiting Pyrenean lentic habitats. Chi-square tests and Generalized Additive Models were applied on a dataset of 12 environmental descriptors from 1739 water bodies surveyed from 2006 to 2016. After accounting for environmental characteristics we found a large negative effect of non-native trout and minnows on Pyrenean amphibians. Trout was negatively associated with four of the six studied species. Since minnows were only introduced in trout present lakes, they were only significant for Rana temporaria, the most distributed amphibian in the area. None of the palatable amphibians have been able to recolonise the lakes where minnow remain as the only fish species indicating a strong negative effect. Minnow is the non-native fish with a higher introduction rate in the mountain range indicating that it might be a threat for other species in the future. Therefore, the control of trout stocking and minnow release in high mountain lakes is necessary to preserve European and worldwide amphibian populations in these ecosystems.},

Trends in the use of foods were comparable to those of other central Rocky Mountain populations, with minor differences likely reflecting regional habitat and forage availability. Five activities (bedding, sweet vetch digging, insect feeding, frugivory, and ungu-late kills) were identified for each of 1,032 field-visited global positioning system radiotelemetry locations from 9 female grizzly bears. We predicted the probability of each activity during relevant periods by time of day (crepuscular, diurnal, and nocturnal) and habitat. Selection ratios were used to assess which habitat and time periods were selected. Activity patterns changed considerably over a 24-h period, with foraging activities occurring mostly during diurnal and crepuscular periods and bedding at night. Habitats were important predictors of activity. Forested areas were selected for bedding areas, whereas digging, insect-foraging, and frugivory activities were associated with herbaceous, recently disturbed forest and open-canopy forests. We suggest that researchers consider behavior and time of day in analyses of habitat selection to improve explanations of habitat use and mechanisms of selection.},

  abstract = {Conventional theories of population and community dynamics are based on a single currency such as number of individuals, biomass, carbon or energy. However, organisms are constructed of multiple elements and often require them (in particular carbon, phosphorus and nitrogen) in different ratios than provided by their resources; this mismatch may constrain the net transfer of energy and elements through trophic levels. Ecological stoichiometry, the study of the balance of elements in ecological processes, offers a framework for exploring ecological effects of such constraints. We review recent theoretical and empirical studies that have considered how stoichiometry may affect population and community dynamics. These studies show that stoichiometric constraints can affect several properties of populations (e.g. stability, oscillations, consumer extinction) and communities (e.g. coexistence of competitors, competitive interactions between different guilds). We highlight gaps in general knowledge and focus on areas of population and community ecology where incorporation of stoichiometric constraints may be particularly fruitful, such as studies of demographic bottlenecks, spatial processes, and multi-species interactions. Finally, we suggest promising directions for new research by recommending potential study systems (terrestrial insects, detritivory-based webs, soil communities) to improve our understanding of populations and communities. Our conclusion is that a better integration of stoichiometric principles and other theoretical approaches in ecology may allow for a richer understanding of both population and community structure and dynamics.

  abstract = {Predators affect prey by killing them directly (lethal effects) and by inducing costly antipredator behaviours in living prey (risk effects). Risk effects can strongly influence prey populations and cascade through trophic systems. A prerequisite for assessing risk effects is characterizing the spatiotemporal variation in predation risk. Risk effects research has experienced rapid growth in the last several decades. However, preliminary assessments of the resultant literature suggest that researchers characterize predation risk using a variety of techniques. The implications of this methodological variation for inference and comparability among studies have not been well recognized or formally synthesized. We couple a literature survey with a hierarchical framework, developed from established theory, to quantify the methodological variation in characterizing risk using carnivore\textendash ungulate systems as a case study. Via this process, we documented 244 metrics of risk from 141 studies falling into at least 13 distinct subcategories within three broader categories. Both empirical and theoretical work suggest risk and its effects on prey constitute a complex, multi-dimensional process with expressions varying by spatiotemporal scale. Our survey suggests this multi-scale complexity is reflected in the literature as a whole but often underappreciated in any given study, which complicates comparability among studies and leads to an overemphasis on documenting the presence of risk effects rather than their mechanisms or scale of influence. We suggest risk metrics be placed in a more concrete conceptual framework to clarify inference surrounding risk effects and their cascading effects throughout ecosystems. We recommend studies (i) take a multi-scale approach to characterizing risk; (ii) explicitly consider `true' predation risk (probability of predation per unit time); and (iii) use risk metrics that facilitate comparison among studies and the evaluation of multiple competing hypotheses. Addressing the pressing questions in risk effects research, including how, to what extent and on what scale they occur, requires leveraging the advantages of the many methods available to characterize risk while minimizing the confusion caused by variability in their application.},

The presence of damselflies would have a positive correlation with environmental integrity, and dragonflies a negative one due to their contrasting ecophysiological requirements. The environmen-tal integrity of each site was estimated based on the Habitat integrity index (HII), which was modified for this study in an urban area. The hypothesis that would be differences in assemblage composition between streams in differently urbanized areas was supported, possibly because most damselfly species are considered to be specialists that are found in pristine habitats, whereas dragonflies seem to be generalists and are likely to be found in disturbed environments. The ordination indicated systematic differences in community composition based on the degree of conservation of the environment, with the communities found in well-preserved habitats being distinct from those found in intermediate and degraded ones. Differences in the composition of odonate communities reflect differences in the integrity of the environment, but they can also provide a measure of the intensity of impacts, thus contributing to the development of effective conservation strategies. In addition, the HII, which is applied rapidly and easily, provides environmental managers with an objective measure of the degree of alteration of aquatic habitats. Maintenance of forest cover along watercourses is clearly essential for the conservation of hydrological resources and the aquatic organisms that depend on these environments.},

We used a small mammal exclosure experiment to explore whether rodents in a southeastern old field directly altered the aboveground plant species composition and chemistry, and indirectly altered the belowground soil community composition and activity. In general, when rodents were excluded, C3 graminoids increased in cover and biomass, contributing toward a shift in plant species composition relative to plots where rodents were present. The plant community chemistry also shifted; plant fiber concentration and carbon : nitrogen were higher, whereas plant nitrogen concentration was lower in exclosure plots relative to access plots. While microbial community enzyme activity increased when rodents were excluded, no significant changes in the fungal : bacterial or potential nitrogen mineralization occurred between treatments. Our results show that rodents can rapidly influence aboveground plant community composition and chemistry, but their influence on belowground processes may require plant inputs to the soil to accumulate over longer periods of time.},

  abstract = {Because many large mammal species have wide geographical ranges, spatially distant populations may be confronted with different sets of environmental conditions. Investigating how home range (HR) size varies across environmental gradients should yield a better understanding of the factors affecting large mammal ecology. We evaluated how HR size of a large herbivore, the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), varies in relation to seasonality, latitude (climate), weather, plant productivity and landscape features across its geographical range in Western Europe. As roe deer are income breeders, expected to adjust HR size continuously to temporal variation in food resources and energetic requirements, our baseline prediction was for HR size to decrease with proxies of resource availability. We used GPS locations of roe deer collected from seven study sites (EURODEER collaborative project) to estimate fixed-kernel HR size at weekly and monthly temporal scales. We performed an unusually comprehensive analysis of variation in HR size among and within populations over time across the geographical range of a single species using generalized additive mixed models and linear mixed models, respectively. Among populations, HR size decreased with increasing values for proxies of forage abundance, but increased with increases in seasonality, stochastic variation of temperature, latitude and snow cover. Within populations, roe deer HR size varied over time in relation to seasonality and proxies of forage abundance in a consistent way across the seven populations. Thus, our findings were broadly consistent across the distributional range of this species, demonstrating a strong and ubiquitous link between the amplitude and timing of environmental seasonality and HR size at the continental scale. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.

However, because of human activities, over half of the wetland ecosystems existing in North America, Europe, Australia, and China in the early 20th century have been lost. Ecological restoration to recover critical ecosystem services has been widely attempted, but the degree of actual recovery of ecosystem functioning and structure from these efforts remains uncertain. Our results from a meta-analysis of 621 wetland sites from throughout the world show that even a century after restoration efforts, biological structure (driven mostly by plant assemblages), and biogeochemical functioning (driven primarily by the storage of carbon in wetland soils), remained on average 26\% and 23\% lower, respectively, than in reference sites. Either recovery has been very slow, or postdisturbance systems have moved towards alternative states that differ from reference conditions. We also found significant effects of environmental settings on the rate and degree of recovery. Large wetland areas ({$>$}100 ha) and wetlands restored in warm (temperate and tropical) climates recovered more rapidly than smaller wetlands and wetlands restored in cold climates. Also, wetlands experiencing more (riverine and tidal) hydrologic exchange recovered more rapidly than depressional wetlands. Restoration performance is limited: current restoration practice fails to recover original levels of wetland ecosystem functions, even after many decades. If restoration as currently practiced is used to justify further degradation, global loss of wetland ecosystem function and structure will spread.},

We need to learn how those behaviours interact in an overall strategy of risk management, how strategies vary with changing conditions, and whether some behaviours might compensate for others. I addressed these issues with manipulative experiments evaluating how snowshoe hares' (Lepus americanus) vigilance varies with their giving-up densities (GUDs) in artificial food patches. I tested whether the results, collected when there was no evidence of predation, were congruent with an earlier study under higher predation. When predator sign was common, vigilance depended directly on habitat. But when risk was low, habitat's influence on vigilance was indirect. Hares were least vigilant during the new moon where the distance to escape habitat was far, but only in open risky habitat. Hares were more vigilant during the full moon, but only at stations far from escape habitat. Moon phase and additional cover had no effect on GUDs that were highest at open risky stations far from escape habitat. The results suggest that reduced risk allowed hares to allocate less time to vigilance, but they needed to forage for similar amounts of food during each moon phase to maintain their energetic state.

We simulated different home range sizes and shapes by mixing bivariate-normal distributions and then drawing random samples of various sizes from these distributions. We compared fixed-kernel density estimates with and without error to the true underlying distributions. The effects of telemetry error on fixed-kernel density estimates were related to sample size, distribution complexity, and ratio of median Circular Error Probable to home range size. We suggest a metric to assess the adequacy of the telemetry system being used to estimate an animal's space use before a study is undertaken. Telemetry location error is unlikely to significantly affect fixed-kernel density estimates for most wildlife telemetry studies with adequate sample sizes.},

However, understanding where these connecting elements should be placed in the landscape is critical if they are to provide both value for money and for biodiversity. For such planning to be effective, it is necessary to have information of the distributions of multiple taxa, however, this is of poor quality for many taxa. We show that sparse, non-systematically collected biological records can be modelled using readily available environmental variables to meaningfully predict potential biodiversity richness, including rare and threatened species, across a landscape. Using a large database of ad-hoc biological records (50 501 records of 502 species) we modelled the richness of wetland biodiversity across the Fens, a formerly extensive wetland, now agricultural landscape in eastern England. We used these models to predict those parts of the agricultural ditch network of greatest potential conservation value and compared this to current strategic network planning. Odonata distribution differed to that of other groups, indicating that single taxon groups may not be effective proxies for other priority biodiversity. Our results challenged previous assumptions that river channels should comprise the main connecting elements in the Fens region. Rather, areas of high ditch density close to a main river are likely to be of greater value and should be targeted for enhancement. This approach can be adopted elsewhere in order to improve the evidence-base for strategic networks plans, increasing their value for money.},

Carbon steel (C1010), aluminum alloy (Al1100), and stainless steel (SS304L) were used in the test program to evaluate the use of water, soapy water, and a commercial salt remover in washing practices. The corrosion behavior of metals was studied using linear polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. Digital photos and scanning electron microscopy revealed the surface morphology of corrosion coupons. The salt remover could significantly enhance the corrosion resistance of carbon steel and stainless steel in a 30\%-by-weight MgCl 2 solution, but not that of the aluminum alloy. Further investigation focused on the evaluation of an innovative sugar beet by-product for use as a deicer additive. A modified dip-dry test was employed to simulate the field conditions. Bare and coated C1010 samples were used to evaluate the potential anticorrosion benefits of this green deicer additive. The corrosion behavior of the samples was characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The use of sugar beet by-product can enhance the corrosion resistance of carbon steel and the mechanism of protection is the formation of a temporary protective layer on the metallic surface.},

Grizzly bear mortalities were concentrated in three main regions of the CRE: (1) Lake Louise; (2) Banff town site; and (3) Alberta Provincial lands near the Red Deer River. We found no evidence for environmental differences in mortality locations between sexes or seasons, while sub-adult male and legal harvest mortalities were more dispersed than other mortalities. Models describing the relative risk of mortality were positively associated with human access, water, and edge features, while negatively associated with terrain ruggedness and greenness indices. Model predictions fit well with independent data. Overall, relatively little of the landscape was secure from human-caused mortality for grizzly bears.

  abstract = {The members of the plant family asteraceae are noted for their cosmopolitan distribution and their versatility is attributed to be largely due to their morphological adaptations. Interestingly members of this family are endowed with rich levels of secondary plant metabolites, many of which are photochemically active (Bakker et al. 1979; Kagan et al. 1989). The secondary plant metabolite alpha-terthienyl derived from the plant family asteraceae is among the new class of light activated insecticide. The photobiocidal effects associated with alpha-terthienyl in presence of sunlight and ultraviolet light (300-400 nm), has stimulated a great deal of interest in its toxic mechanism of action against a number of organisms including phytopathogenic fungi, nematodes and mosquito larvae. Trials under tropical conditions indicate a very high level of activity as a larvicide to mosquito. There is no cross resistance to this compound in malathion resistant mosquito larvae (Arnason et al. 1989). Even though many researchers feel that the phototoxicity of secondary plant metabolites has arisen independently many times in evolution as a defense mechanism, the physiological impact of such biologically active compounds in the plant producing them also should be addressed (Arnason et al. 1987). Moreover, the accumulation of secondary plant metabolites in the roots of many asteraceae members as is the case with alpha-terthienyl in marigold (Tagetes sp.) roots, hints towards their functional divergence. In this study, we demonstrate a potent heavy metal quenching activity of alpha-terthienyl.},

However, the contribution of these changing configurations in weather to total factor productivity (TFP) growth has not been addressed explicitly in econometric analyses. Thus, the key objective of this study is to quantify and to investigate the role of changing weather patterns in explaining yearly fluctuations in TFP. For this purpose, we define TFP to be a measure of total output divided by a measure of total input. We estimate a stochastic production frontier model using U.S. state-level agricultural data incorporating growing season temperature and precipitation, and intra-annual standard deviations of temperature and precipitation for the period 1960-2004. We use the estimated parameters of the model to compute a TFP index that has good axiomatic properties. We then decompose TFP growth in each state into weather effects, technological progress, technical efficiency, and scale-mix efficiency changes. This approach improves our understanding of the role of different components of TFP in agricultural productivity growth. We find that annual TFP growth averaged 1.56\% between 1960 and 2004. Moreover, we observe substantial heterogeneity in weather effects across states and over time.},

Landscape ecology provides important frameworks for understanding and conserving urban biodiver-sity both within cities and considering whole cities in their regional context, and has played an important role in the de-velopment of a substantial and expanding body of knowledge about urban landscapes and communities. Characteristics of the whole city including size, overall amount of green space, age and regional context are important considerations for un-derstanding and planning for biotic assemblages at the scale of entire cities, but have received relatively little research atten-tion. Studies of biodiversity within cities are more abundant and show that longstanding principles regarding how patch size, configuration and composition influence biodiversity ap-ply to urban areas as they do in other habitats. However, the fine spatial scales at which urban areas are fragmented and the altered temporal dynamics compared to non-urban areas indi-cate a need to apply hierarchical multi-scalar landscape ecol-ogy models to urban environments. Transferring results from landscape-scale urban biodiversity research into planning re-mains challenging, not least because of the requirements for urban green space to provide multiple functions. An increas-ing array of tools is available to meet this challenge and increasingly requires ecologists to work with planners to ad-dress biodiversity challenges. Biodiversity conservation and enhancement is just one strand in urban planning, but is in-creasingly important in a rapidly urbanising world.},

Abstract: Large carnivores need large areas of relatively wild habitat, which makes their conservation chal-lenging. These species play important ecological roles and in some cases may qualify as keystone species. Al-though the ability of carnivores to control prey numbers varies according to many factors and often is effec-tive only in the short term, the indirect effects of carnivores on community structure and diversity can be great. Perhaps just as important is the role of carnivores as umbrella species (i.e., species whose habitat area requirements encompass the habitats of many other species). Conservation areas large enough to support populations of large carnivores are likely to include many other species and natural communities, especially in regions such as the Rocky Mountains of Canada and the United States that have relatively low endemism. For example, a plan for recovery of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) proposed by Shaffer (1992) covers, in part, 34\% of the state of Idaho (compared to 8\% covered by a US. Fish and Wildlife Service proposal) and would capture 10\% or more of the statewtide ranges of 71\% of the mammal species, 67\% of the birds, 61\% of the am-phibians, but only 27\% of the reptiles native to Idaho. Two-thirds (67\%) of the vegetation types in Idaho would have 10\% or more of their statewide area included in the Shaffer plan. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser-vice recovery zones provide a much poorer umbrella. The umbrella functions of large carnivores are expected to be poorer in regions with high endemism. The application of metapopulation concepts to large carnivore conservation has led to proposals for regional reserve networks composed of wilderness core areas, multiple-use buffer zones, and some form of connectivity. The exceptional vagility of most large carnivores makes such networks feasible in a region with low human population density, such as the Rocky Mountains, but mortal-ity risks still need to be addressed. Roads are a major threat to carnivore recovery because of barrier effects, vehicle collisions, and increased accessibility of wild areas to poachers. Development, especially for tourism, is also becoming a threat in many parts of the region. Biologia de la Conservaci6n y Conservacion de Carnivoros en las Montanias Rocallosas Resumen: Los carnivoros mayores requieren de extensas areas de habitat relativamente natural, lo cual hace de su conservaci6n un reto. Estas especies juegan un papel ecol6gico importante y pueden, en algunos casos, ser consideradas como especies clave. Aunque la capacidad de los carnivoros para controlar la abun-dancia de sus presas varta en funci6n de numerososfactores y a menudo solo es a corto plazo, los efectos in-directos de los carnivoros sobre la estructura y diversidad de la comunidadpueden ser grandes. Posiblemente igual importancia tiene elpapel de los carniivoros como especies sombrilla (i.e., especies cuyos requerimien-tos de extensi6n del habitat comprenden los habitats de muchas otras especies). Es probable que areas de con-servaci6n suficientemente grandes para mantener poblaciones de carnivoros mayores incluyan muchas otras especies y comunidades naturales, especialmente en regiones con endemismo relativamente bajo, tal como las Monta--as Rocalosas.

  abstract = {Metapopulation models typically assume that suitable habitats occupied by local populations and unsuitable matrix separating them form a 'black-and-white' landscape mosaic, in which dispersal is primarily determined by the spatial configuration of habitat patches. In reality, however, the matrix composition is also likely to influence dispersal. Using intensive mark-recapture surveys we investigated inter-patch movements in Maculinea (Phengaris) nausithous and M. teleius occurring sympatrically in six metapopulations. Three of these metapopulations had the matrix dominated by forest, an inhospitable environment for grassland butterflies, whereas in the remaining three the matrix was mostly composed of open environments. Dispersal parameters derived with the Virtual Migration model revealed significant differences between both groups of metapopulations. Both species had a lower propensity to emigrate from their natal habitat patches, and they suffered substantially higher dispersal mortality in the metapopulations with forest matrix. On the other hand, mean dispersal distances were roughly an order of magnitude longer in forest matrix as compared with open landscapes (ca. 500-1,500 vs. 100-200 m). Our results suggest that inhospitable forest matrix induces strong selection against dispersal, leading to a reduced emigration rate. At the same time, the selection may promote emigrants with good dispersal abilities, which are able to perform long-distance movements. Thus, while it is generally believed that a matrix structurally similar to the habitat of a species should improve the functional connectivity of habitat patches, our findings imply that this may not necessarily be the case. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Author(s).},

As ponds are now recognized as freshwater habitats clearly distinct from lakes and running waters, there is a need for standardized tools for assessing their ecological integrity and status, and particularly their biodiversity. 2. A standardized method was developed for sampling and assessing the species richness of ponds. Experiences accumulated in previous studies, together with data gathered from 80 Swiss ponds, provided the basis of the proposed method. 3. Five taxonomic groups were chosen as complementary representatives of pond inhabitants: aquatic plants, aquatic Gastropoda, aquatic Coleoptera, adult Odonata and Amphibia. 4. To sample aquatic flora, quadrats are located along transects perpendicular to the longest axis of the pond. The number of quadrats is calculated from a relationship with pond area. A nonparametric estimator (Jackknife-1) is used to estimate the true species richness from the observed richness. 5. Aquatic invertebrates (Gastropoda, Coleoptera) are collected with a hand net. Sampling is stratified within the dominant habitats. The number of samples is calculated from a relationship with pond area. As with the vegetation, the Jackknife-1 estimator is used to estimate the true species richness. 6. The species richness of adult Odonata is assessed using a standardized field survey method combining observations from early and late summer. The species richness is corrected with an abundance-based estimator (Chao1). The species richness of Amphibia is obtained from an exhaustive inventory. 7. For the assessment of biodiversity, species richness values derived from measurements are compared to values predicted for conditions that enable a high species richness. Generalized Additive Models are used to predict species richness from environmental predictors characterizing the pond. The ratio of measured richness to predicted richness allows the allocation of a quality status to each pond. Results are divided into five biological quality classes, as recommended in the EC Water Framework Directive (WFD).},

  abstract = {Many cities around the world are expanding and this trend in urbanization is expected to sharply increase over coming decades. At the same time, the integration of green and blue spaces is widely promoted in urban development, potentially offering numerous benefits for biodiversity. This is particularly relevant for urban waterbodies, a type of ecosystem present in most cities. However, site managers often lack the knowledge base to promote biodiversity in these waterbodies, which are generally created to provide other ecosystem services. To address this, our review presents guidelines for promoting biodiversity in urban ponds. We found a total of 516 publications indexed in ISI Web of Sciences related to this topic, of which 279 were retained for the purposes of our review. The biodiversity of urban ponds, measured by species richness, appears to be generally lower than in rural ponds; however, urban ponds often support threatened species. Furthermore, if well managed, urban ponds have the potential to support a much greater biodiversity than they currently do. Indeed, this review shows that a range of urban factors can impair or promote pond biodiversity, including many that can easily be controlled by site managers. Local factors include design (surface area, pond depth, banks and margins, shade, shoreline irregularity), water quality (conductivity, nutrients, heavy metals), and hydroperiod and biotic characteristics (stands of vegetation, fish, invasive species). Important regional factors include several indicators of urbanization (roads, buildings, density of population, impervious surfaces, car traffic), and the presence of other wetlands or green spaces in the surrounding landscape. We considered each of these factors and their potential impact on freshwater biodiversity. Taking into account the management measures listed in the publications reviewed, we have proposed a framework for the management of urban ponds, with guidelines to promote biodiversity and other ecosystem services, and to avoid ecosystem disservices or the creation of ecological traps. At the city scale, the biodiversity of a pondscape benefits from a high diversity of pond types, differing in their environmental characteristics and management.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. Regional and global scale ecosystem service assessments have demonstrated the socioeconomic value of protecting biodiversity and have been integrated into associated policy. Local government decision makers are still unsure of the applicability, return on investment, and usefulness of these assessments in aiding their decision making. Cape Town, a developing city in a globally recognized biodiversity hotspot, has numerous competing land uses. City managers, with a tightly constrained budget, requested an exploratory study on the links between ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation within this municipal area. We set out to develop and test a simple and rapid ecosystem service assessment method aimed at determining the contribution natural vegetation remnants make to ecosystem service provision. We took selected services, identified in conjunction with city managers, and assessed these in two ways. First we used an area weighted approach to attribute services to vegetation types and assessed how these had changed through time and into the future given development needs. Second, we did a regulatory and cultural service remnant distance analysis to better understand proximity effects and linkages. Provisioning services were found to have been most severely affected through vegetation transformation. Regulatory services have been similarly affected, and these losses are more significant because regulatory services can only function in situ and cannot be outsourced in the way provisioning services can. The most significant losses were in coastal zone protection and flood mitigation services, both of which will be placed under even greater pressure given the predicted changes in climatic regimes. The role of remnant vegetation in regulating and cultural services was shown to be a significant additional consideration in making the case for conservation in the city. Our rapid assessment approach does not allow for nuanced and individual understanding of the trade-offs presented by individual remnant patches, but is particularly strong in quickly identifying issues, key focus areas, and opportunities provided by this research direction, and thereby serving to facilitate and drive constructive engagement between ecosystem service experts and city planners.},

  abstract = {Individual patterns of habitat use emerge from behavioral decisions driven by interactions between landscape characteristics and individual traits. Individual traits, such as age and sex, influence the net gain of using habitats and associated resources, and thus the relationship between size and composition of the home range. However, the pathways from individual variation in home range size and composition to habitat selection are rarely fully explored. We investigated how habitat selection in moose (Alces alces) was a result of individual traits and home range characteristics, that is, we described the pathway from home range to habitat selection. The study was conducted at two spatial scales during two contrasting seasons. Home range size and composition varied with sex, with season, and to some extent with age. Males had larger home range size, and the composition of their home ranges changed more with home range size than for females. The general trend was that moose used habitats according to availability more in winter than in summer, that is, a weaker habitat selection in winter than in summer. Sex and age explained little of the variation in habitat selection, but sex had a pronounced effect on the relationship between home range size and composition. Because habitat availability (i.e., home range composition) is a component of habitat selection, it suggests that varying habitat use partly compensates for sex-specific differences in home range composition, which in turn results from home range settlement. Hence, although males and females showed similar habitat selection, they differed in the underlying mechanisms generating the pattern of habitat selection. These complex interactions between individual traits and environmental variation have consequences for how we understand the relationships between landscape characteristics, individual behavior, and fitness.},

Additionally, this study finds that urbanities feel very little responsibility for conservation as compared to other actors like farmers and the federal government.

To address this issue, we undertook a systematic review and synthesis of empirical studies based on the views of municipal managers. We extracted information on the concerns, priorities, factors, and actors that influence municipal manager decision-making using a governance framework to extract ideas on the discourses, actors, rules, and resources that influence their decision-making. Out of {$>$} 1400 articles found in searches, only 60 were relevant empirical studies, with 32 of them based in the US. Most studies elicited views from managers using pre-determined surveys/questionnaires. This literature is focused heavily on themes of resources, such as budgets and personnel, as important influences in program performance and urban forest success. Themes related to coordination of actors, such as the coordination of departmental units, were also frequently mentioned but were not explicitly associated with program performance or urban forest success. Future research aimed at gaining insights on urban forest governance and decision-making from the perspective of municipal managers will benefit from distinguishing operational capacities (i.e., budgets, personnel) from management processes (i.e., coordination), and focus on how municipal managers understand, facilitate, and find support in management processes. This will reveal how they implement co-governance and collaborative decision-making. Future research could better extend the knowledge base of existing studies by establishing clear governance frameworks and methods based on the views of managers.},

  abstract = {Decisions about urban forests are critical to urban liveability and resilience. This study aimed to evaluate the range of positions held by urban forest managers from local governments in the state of Victoria, Australia, regarding the management and governance challenges that affect their decision-making. This study was based on a Q-method approach, a procedure that allows researchers to evaluate the range of positions that exist about a topic in a structured manner based on the experiences of a wide group of people. We created statements on a wide range of urban forest management and governance challenges and asked urban forest managers to rate their level of agreement with these statements via an online survey. Managers generally agreed about the challenges posed by urban development and climate change for implementing local government policies on urban forest protection and expansion. However, there were divergent views about how effective solutions based on increasing operational capacities, such as increasing budgets and personnel, could address these challenges. For some managers, it was more effective to improve critical governance challenges, such as inter-departmental and inter-municipal coordination, community engagement, and addressing the culture of risk aversion in local governments. Urban forest regional strategies aimed at coordinating management and governance issues across cities should build on existing consensus on development and environmental threats and address critical management and governance issues not solely related to local government operational capacity.},

  abstract = {Awareness of the benefits of urban trees has led many cities to develop ambitious targets to increase tree numbers and canopy cover. Policy instruments that guide the planning of cities recognize the need for new governance arrangements to implement this agenda. Urban forests are greatly influenced by the decisions of municipal managers, but there is currently no clear understanding of how municipal managers find support to implement their decisions via new governance arrangements. To fill this knowledge gap, we collected empirical data through interviews with 23 urban forest municipal managers in 12 local governments in Greater Melbourne and regional Victoria, Australia, and analysed these data using qualitative interpretative methods through a governance lens. The goal of this was to understand the issues and challenges, stakeholders, resources, processes, and rules behind the decision-making of municipal managers. Municipal managers said that urban densification and expansion were making it difficult for them to implement their strategies to increase tree numbers and canopy cover. The coordination of stakeholders was more important for managers to find support to implement their decisions than having a bigger budget. The views of the public or wider community and a municipal government culture of risk aversion were also making it difficult for municipal managers to implement their strategies. Decision-making priorities and processes were not the same across urban centres. Lack of space to grow trees in new developments, excessive tree removal, and public consultation, were ideas more frequently raised in inner urban centres, while urban expansion, increased active use of greenspaces, and lack of data/ information about tree assets were concerns for outer and regional centres. Nonetheless, inter-departmental coordination was a common theme shared among all cities. Strengthening coordination processes is an important way for local governments to overcome these barriers and effectively implement their urban forest strategies.},

The ongoing epidemic of white-nose syndrome is a multi-scale phenomenon because it causes hibernaculum-level extirpations, while simultaneously spreading over larger spatial scales. We investigate a neglected topic in ecological epidemiology: how local pathogen-driven extirpations impact large-scale pathogen spread. Previous studies have identified risk factors for propagation of WNS over hibernaculum and landscape scales but none of these have tested the hypothesis that separation of spatial scales and disease-induced mortality at the hibernaculum level might slow or halt its spread. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mechanistic multi-scale model parameterized using white-nose syndrome county and site incidence data that connects hibernaculum-level susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) epidemiology to the county-scale contagion process.

The proportion of seeds remaining in each tray (a measure of the giving-up density [GUD]) was used to measure risk perceived by mice. Mice did not alter their GUD when presented with cues of native predators (bobcats, Lynx rufus, and red foxes, Vulpes vulpes), recently introduced predators (coyotes, Canis latrans), nonnative predators (ocelots, Leopardus pardalis), a native herbivore (white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus), or a water control. Rather, GUD was related to microhabitat: rodents removed more seeds from foraging trays sheltered beneath vegetative cover compared with exposed trays outside of cover. Rodents also removed more seeds during nights with precipitation and when moon illumination was low. Our results suggest that P. polionotus used indirect cues rather than direct cues to assess risk of vertebrate predation. Indirect cues may be more reliable than are direct scent cues for estimating risk from multiple vertebrate predators that present the most risk in open environments.},

Despite yards being ubiquitous, little comprehensive information exists on how vegetation varies between front and backyards. This hinders our ability to optimize greening interventions on private urban land. We devised an accurate GIS algorithm to locate and classify front and backyards within residential landscapes. By applying this method to the greater Boston area, we measured vegetation structure (i.e., canopy cover, height and volume) of front and backyards with LiDAR and multispectral imagery. We further investigated relationships between urban form, architectural style, socio-economics, and the structure of front and backyard vegetation across Boston's residential landscapes. Among the 85,732 residential parcels that were not corner lots and had cadastral and architectural data available, backyards were twice as large as front yards on average and had significantly greater canopy cover, vegetation volume and taller trees. Parcel-level characteristics, including vegetation in the corresponding front or backyard, as well as morphological characteristics of parcels, were the best predictors of vegetation structure. House architectural style was related to vegetation structure. The neighborhood socio-economic characteristics were the least important factors in predicting yard vegetation structure.},

Our knowledge of the spatial structure of urban land and ecological systems is expanding. These systems have been investigated across spatial scales, urban to rural gradients, networks of urban macrosystems, and global megalopolises. However, the temporal dimensions of urban ecosystems \textendash{} such as those related to ecological cycles and historical legacies \textendash{} are far less understood and investigated. Here, we outline the main dimensions of time that can shape how events in urban ecosystems unfold, which we categorize as: (i) time flows and duration, (ii) synchrony, lags, and delays, (iii) trends and transitions, (iv) cycles and hysteresis, (v) legacies and priming, (vi) temporal hotspots and hot moments, and (vii) stochastic vs. deterministic processes affecting our ability to forecast the future of cities and the species that live in them. First, we demonstrate the roles of these understudied dimensions by discussing exemplary studies. We then propose key future research directions for investigating how processes over time may regulate the structure and functioning of urban land and biodiversity, as well as its effects on and implications for urban ecology. Our analysis and conceptual framework highlights that several temporal dimensions of urban ecosystems \textendash{} like those related to temporal hotspots/moments and stochastic vs. deterministic processes \textendash{} are understudied. This offers important research opportunities to further urban ecology and a comprehensive research agenda valuing the ``Urban Chronos'' \textendash{} the change of urban ecosystems through time.},

Recent studies have increasingly tested these assumptions and provide empirical evidence for the contributions of tree planting programs, as well as their feasibility and limits, for solving or mitigating urban environmental and social issues. We propose that current evidence supports local cooling, stormwater absorption, and health benefits of urban trees for local residents. However, the potential for urban trees to appreciably mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution over a wide array of sites and environmental conditions is limited. Consequently, urban trees appear to be more promising for climate and pollution adaptation strategies than mitigation strategies. In large part, this is due to space constraints limiting the extent of urban tree canopies relative to the current magnitude of emissions. The most promising environmental and health impacts of urban trees are those that can be realized with well-stewarded tree planting and localized design interventions at site to municipal scales. Tree planting at these scales has documented benefits on local climate and health, which can be maximized through targeted site design followed by monitoring, adaptive management, and studies of long-term eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

The principles determining how prey trade time between the detection of predators and food acquisition are not fully understood, particularly in herbivores because of many potential confounding factors (such as group size), and the ability of these animals to be vigilant while handling food. We designed a fertilization experiment to manipulate the quality of resources, and compared awareness (distin-guishing apprehensive foraging and vigilance) of wild impalas (Aepyceros melampus) foraging on patches of different grass height and quality in a wilderness area with a full community of predators. While handling food, these animals can allocate time to other functions. The impalas were aware of their environment less often when on good food patches and when the grass was short. The animals spent more time in apprehensive foraging when grass was tall, and no other variable affected apprehensive behavior. The probability of exhibiting a vigilance posture decreased with group size. The interaction between grass height and patch enrichment also affected the time spent in vigilance, suggesting that resource quality was the main driver when visibility is good, and the risk of predation the main driver when the risk is high. We discuss various possible mechanisms underlying the perception of predation risk: foraging strategy, opportunities for scrounging, and inter-individual interference. Overall, this experiment shows that improving patch quality modifies the trade-off between vigilance and foraging in favor of feeding, but vigilance remains ultimately driven by the visibility of predators by foragers within their feeding patches.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In recent years, it has been argued that the effect of predator fear exacts a greater demographic toll on prey populations than the direct killing of prey. However, efforts to quantify the effects of fear have primarily relied on experiments that replace predators with predator cues. Inter- pretation of these experiments must consider two important caveats: (1) the magnitude of experi- menter-induced predator cues may not be realistically comparable to those of the prey's natural sensory environment, and (2) given functional predators are removed from the treatments, the fear effect is measured in the absence of any consumptive effects, a situation which never occurs in nature. We contend that demographic consequences of fear in natural populations may have been overesti- mated because the intensity of predator cues applied by experimenters in the majority of studies has been unnaturally high, in some instances rarely occurring in nature without consumption. Further- more, the removal of consumption from the treatments creates the potential situation that individual prey in poor condition (those most likely to contribute strongly to the observed fear effects via starva- tion or reduced reproductive output) may have been consumed by predators in nature prior to the expression of fear effects, thus confounding consumptive and fear effects. Here, we describe an alter- native treatment design that does not utilize predator cues, and in so doing, better quantifies the demographic effect of fear on wild populations. This treatment substitutes the traditional cue experi- ment where consumptive effects are eliminated and fear is simulated with a design where fear is removed and consumptive effects are simulated through the experimental removal of prey. Compar- ison to a natural population would give a more robust estimate of the effect of fear in the presence of consumption on the demographic variable of interest. This approach represents a critical advance in quantifying the mechanistic pathways through which predation structures ecological communities. Discussing the merits of both treatments will motivate researchers to go beyond simply describing the existence of fear effects and focus on testing their true magnitude in wild populations and natural communities.

  abstract = {Habitat fragmentation of semi-natural habitats is a serious problem in nature conservation because it leads to a decrease in habitat area and an increase of the isolation of habitat islands. In this paper, we examined the effects of habitat fragmentation on species richness and assemblages of four taxo-nomic groups. First, we used species-area relationships to assess the effect of habitat area on species richness per habitat island. Second, cumulative species-area curves were used to assess the question whether large habitat islands contain more species than several small islands of the same total area. Third, we examined to what extent species assemblages of species-poor habitat islands are nested subsets of those of species-rich ones. We analysed presence-absence data of vascular plants and bryophytes in 36, and of day-active butterflies and grasshoppers in a subset of 23 habitat islands (montane calcareous fens). The species-area relationship of each group was positive but was highly significant only for vascular plants. The slopes of the relationship on the log-log-scale were rather low (z-values: 0.06-0.11). The cumulative species-area curves of all groups showed that a set of small habitat islands contained more species than a set of a few large habitat islands with the same total area. The results of our nestedness analyses depended on the underlying null models of the test statistics. Applying the method of Wright \& Reeves (1992), all groups were significantly nested within the archipelago of habitat islands. Yet, using the method of Brualdi \& Sanderson (1999), none of the groups showed non-random patterns. Our study showed that species richness increased with the area of habitat islands, but overlap among them was so low that even small habitat islands contributed to overall species richness. Therefore, a mosaic of several wetland islands, including small ones, is necessary to maintain species diversity at the landscape level.

Stormwater ponds have been constructed in North American cities to mitigate the effects of increased urban runoff by dampening floods and filtering out contaminants. However, these ponds may also provide habitat for wetland species in cities. This study aimed at determining the significance of stormwater ponds as attractive habitats for the adult stages of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies), widely considered bioindicators of aquatic and wetland ecosystem health. A total of 41 urban stormwater ponds and ten rural natural ponds were sampled across the National Capital Region of Canada. On average, stormwater ponds had fewer species and lower abundance of dragonflies but, in contrast, more species of damselflies. Stormwater ponds had a higher total plant species richness because of a higher number of non-native species. However, some stormwater ponds had similar odonate and plant species assemblages to natural ponds. The variation in odonate abundance and species composition was largely explained by plant community composition and significantly linked to the presence of specific obligate wetland plant species. Overall, this study highlights the importance of wetland features in cities and points to design elements of stormwater ponds that could be implemented to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {As cities expand, urban ecosystems could either contribute to or impede conservation efforts. To maximize the potential for urban areas to support biodiversity, there is a need to understand how systems in an urban environment can sustain the natural history requirements of species. This study compared the relative importance of local-scale factors (plant communities and water quality) to landscape factors (surrounding land cover) in structuring assemblages of a recognized group of wetland bioindicators. Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies), at both the adult and larval life stages, along with plant communities, pond water quality and surrounding land cover types were sampled at 51 ponds across a north temperate metropolitan area. Plant communities (particularly of wetland species) consistently explained the largest amount of variation in both dragonfly and damselfly community structure at all life stages. Pond water quality was of secondary importance for both aquatic and terrestrial life stages, with dragonflies more negatively affected by urban contaminants than damselflies. Overall, surrounding land cover types in pond catchments explained less variation in Odonata community structure, especially in the case of damselflies. However, the presence of adjacent ponds and wetlands had a measurable effect. Plant, water quality and land cover variables together explained as much as half of the variation in Odonata community structure at ponds. Urban ponds could potentially provide high quality habitat for species when designed and managed to promote native wetland plant communities and water quality is maintained.},

Such responses are predicted to vary among individuals as a function of the level of risk to which individuals are exposed, temporal changes in risk, and landscape-mediated changes in perceived risk. We tested how GPS-tracked moose (Alces alces, n = 19) responded to an emerging risk landscape with the introduction of hunting to a na\"ive population (large-scale reduction experiment in Gros Morne National Park, Canada). We predicted that predation risk associated with hunters would influence moose habitat selection: Avoidance responses would be stronger during the day when hunting was allowed, and moose would learn to avoid risky locations which would strengthen in successive years for survivors occupying overall riskier home ranges. We found that moose avoided areas associated with a high risk of encounters with hunters but did not alter selection patterns between day and night. We did not find evidence of moose reacting more strongly to emerging risk as a function of risk within their home range. Moose did not increase their avoidance of areas associated with hunter risk across years but over time survivors selected non-hunted refuge areas more frequently. Our results suggest that while moose did not adjust fine-scale habitat selection through time to increased hunting risk, they did adjust selection at broader scales (based on proportions of hunter-free habitat included in home range relative to study area). This finding supports the hypothesis that habitat selection at larger spatio-temporal scales may reflect behavioral responses to a population's most important limiting factors, which may not be apparent at finer scales.},

  abstract = {Urban vegetation is shown to be unevenly distributed across cities and there is evidence of disparities in benefits provided by vegetation and of public health problems induced by urban heat islands. In order to improve vegetation cover, it remains crucial to understand the underpinning of such unevenness. In this paper, we investigate in Montreal (Canada) how the built environment, sociodemographic factors and administrative boroughs influence tree and lawn cover in public and residential land. The analysis was conducted at the dissemination area (DA) level, a Canadian census unit containing about 400\textendash 700 people. Six vegetation indicators were used as dependent variables: the proportion of a DA covered by trees/shrubs, lawn and total vegetation; the proportion of streets covered by trees/shrubs and the proportion of residential yards covered by trees/shrubs and total vegetation. Three sets of independent variables were studied: the built environment, sociodemographics and borough names. We used spatial autoregressive models to control for dependence and the spatial autoregressive term explained a large amount of variability in vegetation cover. The built-environment variables tend to have higher effects than the socio-demographic variables when predicting the three DA vegetation indicators, backyard vegetation, and to a lesser degree, street tree/shrub cover. In particular, population density is associated negatively to all indicators but positively to street tree cover. Socio-demographics are substantial in the explanation of the distribution of street trees, especially the presence of recent immigrants (negative effect) and of university degree holders (positive effect). These findings call for appropriate greening programs adapted to the local socio-demographic profile. The significance of boroughs also suggests the need for further research on the impact of within-city administrative hierarchies on the unevenness of urban vegetation.},

Unlike most hibernators, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) are aroused easily while in dens and disturbances while denning can result in fitness costs if bears become active during this period. Our objectives were to determine den selection of male and female grizzly bears at multiple spatial scales in the boreal forest and Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. Grizzly bears in Alberta are designated as threatened. However, little is known about den selection by grizzly bears in the boreal forest and the current land and forest management plans do not include any mitigation measures to minimize possible impacts on the denning habitat of grizzly bears. We compared dens to random available locations within fall home ranges using geographic information system\textendash{} derived anthropogenic, land cover, landscape, and food resource variables. Male and female grizzly bears had similar habitat requirements when selecting dens, and females did not avoid sites associated with a greater probability of encountering males. At the broadest scale investigated, grizzly bears avoided wetlands, and selected high-elevation, dry conifer stands with abundant high-quality spring food. At more localized scales, grizzly bears selected areas of low road densities and dense conifers associated with little high-quality autumn food. Slope angle had the most influence on den selection followed by percent autumn food, road densities, percent wetland, and percent spring food. We recommend limiting human disturbance, including open roads, within core grizzly bear conservation areas for areas with high suitable den habitat.},

This paper addresses complex influences on bluespace accessibility through qualitative research into perceptions of urban waterways, with a focus on non-use. It aims to reveal what distinguishes these as spaces available for outdoor recreation in terms of deterrents to access. Results highlight the significance of spatial characteristics as reasons for avoiding bluespaces: unguarded water and a history of negative narratives limit their appeal. Analysis finds risk perception a strong influence on choice of outdoor destinations, an absolute limit rather than a nuisance, particularly for vulnerable groups. Designers and managers of urban bluespaces can encourage use through enhancing environmental quality. Improved cleanliness, lighting, and surveillance will improve their sense of safety. This research suggests a need to assess sites from varied perspectives, mindful of vulnerable people's experiences, to identify how perceived risks can be mitigated. To further equitable access to bluespaces future research should recognise that the influence of spatial characteristics means access constraints may not be generalised across types of space. Additional qualitative investigation of non-use of varied spaces is required to inform interventions to promote access amongst under-represented groups.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous reductions in herbivore abundance and increases in nitrogen deposition have led to radical shifts in plant communities worldwide. While the individual impacts of these human-caused disturbances are apparent, few studies manipulate both herbivory and N, nor differentiate among herbivore guilds, to understand contingencies in the ability of these drivers to affect producer diversity and productivity. As such, understanding how the main and combined effects of increasing soil N with declining herbivores may influence plant community structure and function is critical to better understand the future of grassland ecosystems under multiple global change drivers. In this study, we asked: (a) What are the main effects of small mammal herbivores, invertebrate herbivores, and soil N on plant community structure and function? and (b) Are the effects of invertebrate herbivores and soil N on plant community structure and function contingent on small mammal herbivory? We used a nested design, with invertebrate and soil N treatments nested within small mammal manipulations in an existing tallgrass prairie. We measured plant community structure by quantifying plant richness, evenness, diversity, and composition across two full growing seasons. We also recorded total aboveground biomass to quantify grassland productivity. We found that small mammal herbivores strongly shaped plant diversity, species composition, and productivity. Small mammal herbivores also mediated the effects of soil N and invertebrate herbivores on grassland community structure, but not composition or productivity. Small mammal reduction lowered plant species richness while increasing aboveground biomass and altering compositional similarity. Invertebrate herbivores, in the presence of small mammals, promoted plant dominance by reducing evenness without altering compositional similarity. Additionally, soil nitrogen addition reduced plant richness, but only when small mammals were reduced, and no effects were detected on compositional similarity or productivity. Our findings provide further evidence that temperate grasslands can be strongly influenced by consumers, and that consumers mediate the effects of resources as well as other consumer guilds on producer evenness and richness. Taken together, we provide evidence of strong contingencies in the drivers of grassland structure, with small mammals directly altering plant diversity as well as mediating the effects of soil nitrogen and invertebrate herbivory on plant richness and evenness. Therefore, we suggest it is imperative to consider how consumer guilds and resource types may interact to shape grassland plant communities.},

A variety of predator avoidance strategies exist, but species generally exist along a spectrum with some primarily utilizing behavioral responses to avoid predation and others relying more on morphological defenses to deter predation. North American porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) possess a well-developed predator deterrent strategy (i.e., quills). During the winter, porcupines enter a nutritional bottleneck where they principally rely on endogenous stores to survive winter. We hypothesized that porcupine behavior in winter would, then, be primarily driven by nutritional demands rather than predation risk. To test this trade-off between perceived risk of predation and nutritional stress, we analyzed the length and sinuosity of movement patterns, relative to nutritional condition (urinary urea: creatinine), snow conditions (depth, density), and a risk landscape (predation risk and refuges). As predicted, the sinuosity of movement paths was unrelated to any of our variables, but we detected a strong correlation between lengths of movements with risk landscape. Specifically, the length of porcupine movement declined as the average risk of predation increased, and the presence of refuge trees in their movement path was positively related to path length. Thus, even for animals possessing extreme morphological defenses effective at deterring predation, and during a period of nutritional stress, movement and behavior are nevertheless driven by perceived predation risk.},

We evaluated resource selection for 10 global positioning system collared northern mountain woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in British Columbia, Canada, with seasonal resource selection functions (RSF) developed at the second-order (landscape) and third-order (within home range) scales. To estimate how much habitat was lost due to avoidance, we estimated the zone of influence (ZOI) around multiple developments and modeled realized and potential habitat. Potential habitat was approximated by removing the ZOI from RSF models. By calculating the spatial difference between potential and realized habitat we estimated the amount of indirect habitat loss. Caribou displayed hierarchical avoidance of development, with the greatest avoidance occurring at the second-order. During both seasons caribou avoided high-use roads by 2. km and low-use roads by 1. km. In winter, caribou avoided town by 9. km compared to 3. km in summer. However, in summer caribou avoided mines by 2. km and cabins and camps by 1.5. km, while in winter when human activity was low, avoidance of these features was minor. As a result of avoidance of the cumulative ZOI, approximately 8\% and 2\% of high quality habitat was lost in the study area in winter and summer, respectively. Our study provides an approach to identify the extent and quality of habitat influenced by indirect avoidance. Conservation efforts should prioritize protecting areas of high quality habitat degraded by avoidance in the vicinity of human development. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Among these variables, geology (alkaline vs acidic substrate) and climate (warm/dry vs cold/rainy) were the major determinants of humus forms, scaling mull humus forms from eumull to dysmull and opposing them to mor/moder, while the contribution of tree canopies was negligible. This trend was verified by partial RDA with environment or abundance of tree species from forest canopy as co-factors. The original position of amphi was confirmed: it was the only humus form not included in the gradient of increasing biological activity ordinated according to climate and geology. Results and possible forecasts of humus forms according to global warming were discussed to the light of existing knowledge. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The quality of life of big city dwellers depends on the use of green infrastructure. The idea of a compact city, opposed to urban sprawl, can lead to reduced access to green areas and increased demand for cultural services provided through urban green infrastructure. Considering the above, the aim of the paper was to identify the supply of and demand for cultural ecosystem services related to the urban green spaces in densely built-up urban areas. To find out how important the ability to use green areas for dwellers of the densely built-up areas is, the questionnaire interviews with the residents of the area of the Old Town of Poznan were conducted. Questions in the survey concerned the amount of green spaces and their availability, the way of use, types of activity, factors limiting the use and factors encouraging to visit green spaces and the motives for using green areas away from inhabitants' place of residence. Respondents claim that there is not enough greenery, especially associated with housing and street side greenery; the amount of parks (which they use most) is slightly higher, in their opinion. Limitations that influence utilising green spaces concern both greenery itself (e.g. insufficient recreational infrastructure, neglected green areas) as well as respondent's issues (e.g. lack of free time). Improvements to recreational infrastructure and more well-kept green spaces would encourage respondents to utilise it more often. Active participation of inhabitants in developing and maintaining their closest neighbourhood would allow to enlarge green spaces in housing areas and make them more customized to the residents' needs and requirements in terms of functionality and aesthetic.},

  abstract = {In highly seasonal environments, offspring production by vertebrates is timed to coincide with the annual peak of resource availability. For herbivores, this resource peak is represented by the annual onset and progression of the plant growth season. As plant phenology advances in response to climatic warming, there is potential for development of a mismatch between the peak of resource demands by reproducing herbivores and the peak of resource availability. For migratory herbivores, such as caribou, development of a trophic mismatch is particularly likely because the timing of their seasonal migration to summer ranges, where calves are born, is cued by changes in day length, while onset of the plant-growing season on the same ranges is cued by local temperatures. Using data collected since 1993 on timing of calving by caribou and timing of plant growth in West Greenland, we document the consequences for reproductive success of a developing trophic mismatch between caribou and their forage plants. As mean spring temperatures at our study site have risen by more than 4 degrees C, caribou have not kept pace with advancement of the plant-growing season on their calving range. As a consequence, offspring mortality has risen and offspring production has dropped fourfold.},

Different sources of chloride, i.e. chloride introduced at the fresh stage of concrete (i.e. internal chloride) and chloride entered during the hardened state (i.e. external chloride) may affect the performance of concrete in different ways. For the performance evaluation of reinforced concrete in chloride environment (i.e. both internal and external chloride), there is a need for performing different electrochemical tests to obtain various corrosion parameters that will specify the possibility and the magnitude of corrosion in concrete. In the present study, the results of an experimental investigation that includes different corrosion tests namely potential measurement, corrosion rate measurement and potentiodynamic polarization test have been presented and analyzed to evaluate the performance of concrete both in internal chloride and exter-nal chloride exposure conditions. In addition an attempt is made to correlate the corrosion parameters obtained from internal and external chloride exposure conditions. From the results it was observed that, dropped half-cell potential value obtained from external chloride exposure mostly lie in the active zone obtained from internal chloride exposure. In addition it was observed that there was significant differ-ence in corrosion current values obtained from both internal and external chloride exposure conditions. Further on the basis of overall ranking obtained from the results of critical parameters from different exposure conditions, the performance of different cement\textendash steel combinations against chloride induced rebar corrosion has been evaluated.},

  abstract = {Canadian boreal woodlands and forests cover approximately 3.09 \texttimes{} 10 6 km 2 , located within a larger boreal zone characterized by cool summers and long cold winters. Warming since the 1850s, increases in annual mean temperature of at least 2 \textdegree C between 2000 and 2050 are highly probable. Annual mean temperatures across the Canadian boreal zone could be 4-5 \textdegree C warmer than today's by 2100. All aspects of boreal forest ecosystem function are likely to be affected. Further, several potential "tipping elements"-where exposure to increasing changes in climate may trigger distinct shifts in ecosystem state-can be identified across the Canadian boreal zone. Approximately 40\% of the forested area is underlain by permafrost, some of which is already degrading irreversibly, triggering a process of forest decline and re-establishment lasting several decades, while also releasing significant quantities of greenhouse gases that will amplify the future global warming trend. Warmer temperatures coupled with significant changes in the distribution and timing of annual precipitation are likely to cause serious tree-killing droughts in the west; east of the Great Lakes, however, where precipitation is generally nonlimiting, warming coupled with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide may stimulate higher forest productivity. Large wildfires, which can cause serious economic losses, are expected to become more frequent, but increases in mean annual area burned will be relatively gradual. The most immediate threats could come from endemic forest insect pests that have the potential for population outbreaks in response to relatively small temperature increases. Quantifying the multiple effects of climate change will be challenging, particularly because there are great uncertainties attached to possible interactions among them, as well as with other land-use pressures. Considerable ingenuity will be needed from forest managers and scientists to address the formidable challenges posed by climate change to boreal ecosystems and develop effective strategies to adapt sustainable forest management practices to the impending changes. R\'esum\'e : Les r\'egions bois\'ees et les for\^ets bor\'eales canadiennes couvrent approximativement 3,09 \texttimes{} 10 6 km 2 ; elles sont localis\'ees au sein d'une vaste zone bor\'eale caract\'eris\'ee par des \'et\'es frais et des hivers longs et froids. Avec le r\'echauffement en cours depuis les ann\'ees 1850, des augmentations de la temp\'erature annuelle moyenne d'au moins 2 \textdegree C entre 2000 et 2050 apparaissent comme pouvant \^etre tr\`es probables, et les temp\'eratures moyennes sur l'ensemble de la zone bor\'eale canadienne pourraient augmenter de 4-5 \textdegree C d'ici 2100. Tous les aspects du fonctionnement des \'ecosyst\`emes de la for\^et bor\'eale sont susceptibles d'\^etre affect\'es. De plus, on peut identifier sur l'ensemble de la zone bor\'eale canadienne des \guillemotleft{} \'el\'ements d\'eclencheurs \guillemotright, c'est-a `-dire des cas o\`u l'exposition a ` des changements importants du climat peut provoquer des modifications de l'\'etat des \'ecosyst\`emes. Environ 40 \% des surfaces foresti\`eres se retrouvent sur le perg\'elisol, dont certaines zones connaissent pr\'esentement une d\'egradation irr\'eversible, enclenchant un proces-sus de d\'eclin forestier et de r\'etablissement qui s'\'etendra sur plusieurs d\'ecennies et qui rel\^achera des quantit\'es significatives de gaz a ` effet serre, amplifiant ainsi la tendance au r\'echauffement plan\'etaire. Des temp\'eratures plus chaudes, coupl\'ees a ` des changements significatifs de la distribution spatio-temporelle des pr\'ecipitations, causeront vraisemblablement des s\'echeresses destructrices pour les arbres dans l'ouest du Canada. Cependant, a ` l'est des Grands Lacs, l\`a o\`u les pr\'ecipitations sont g\'en\'eralement abondantes, le r\'echauffement coupl\'e a ` une augmentation du CO 2 pourrait favoriser une plus forte productivit\'e foresti\`ere. On peut s'attendre a ` ce que les vastes feux de for\^et pouvant causer des pertes \'economiques \'enormes deviennent plus fr\'equents, mais les augmentations annuelles moyennes des surfaces br\^ul\'ees se feront relativement graduellement. La menace la plus imm\'ediate pourrait venir d'insectes forestiers ravageurs ayant la capacit\'e de conna\^itre des \'epid\'emies provoqu\'ees par des augmentations relativement faibles des tem-p\'eratures. La quantification des multiples effets du changement climatique pr\'esente un d\'efi, surtout compte tenu des grandes incertitudes concernant les interactions possibles entre elles, aussi bien qu'avec les autres changements venant de l'utilisation des terres. Il faudra beaucoup d'ing\'eniosit\'e de la part des am\'enagistes et des scientifiques pour faire face aux formidables d\'efis pos\'es par le changement climatique dans les \'ecosyst\`emes de la zone bor\'eale et pour d\'evelopper des strat\'egies efficaces afin d'adapter les pratiques d'am\'enagement forestier durables aux changements imminents.

  abstract = {We contend diets and habitats that allow animals to select among alternatives enable individuals to better meet needs for nutrients and to better cope with toxins. All plants contain toxins, and the amount of toxin an animal can ingest depends on the kinds and amounts of nutrients and toxins in the forages on offer. Nutrients and toxins both cause animals to satiate, and excesses of nutrients, nutrient imbalances, and toxins all limit food intake. Thus, individuals can better meet their needs for nutrients and regulate their intake of toxins when offered a variety of foods that differ in nutrients and toxins than when constrained to a single food, even if the food is "nutritionally balanced". Food intake and preference also depend on differences in how individual animals are built morphologically and how they function physiologically, and marked variation is common even among closely related animals in needs for nutrients and abilities to cope with toxins. Transient food aversions compound the inefficiency of single-food diets-whether in confinement, on pastures, or on rangelands-by depressing intake among individual animals, even if they are suited "on average" to that nutrient or toxin profile. Thus, feeding and grazing practices that allow producers to capitalize on the individuality of animals are likely to improve performance of the herd by enabling the uniqueness of individuals to become manifest. Finally, past experiences play a crucial role in an animal's propensity to learn to eat different foods. When herbivores are allowed to eat only the most preferred plants, they are not likely to learn to mix foods high in nutrients with foods that contain toxins. Conversely, herbivores encouraged to eat all plants in an area are more likely to learn to eat mixes of plants that mitigate toxicity. Experienced animals who have learned to eat a variety of foods that differ in nutrients and toxins do so even when nutritious alternatives are available, whereas naive animals familiar only with the nutritious alternatives eat only that subset of familiar foods. Different systems of management alter how animals forage. Continuous grazing at low stock densities encourages selectivity and reduces diet and habitat breadth, whereas short-duration grazing at high stock densities increases diet and habitat breadth. Thus, what was traditionally considered proper grazing management-rotational grazing at low stock densities-may have trained generations of livestock to "eat the best and leave the rest" thus inadvertently accelerating a decline in biodiversity and an increase in the abundance of less desirable plant species.},

It has specialized habitat requirements and has been viewed, traditionally, as a poor disperser. Knowledge of its dispersal ability was considered in its Biodiversity Species Action Plan as essential for the formulation of appropriate conservation management strategies. 2 Mark\textendash release\textendash recapture (MRR) studies of C. mercuriale in two large UK heathland populations were undertaken. Mature adults had a low rate of movement within continuous areas of habitat (average {$<$} 25 m movement), low emigration rates (1{$\cdot$}3\textendash 11{$\cdot$}4\%) and low colonization distances (maximum 1 km), all comparable to similarly sized coenagrionids. 3 Movements were more likely within than between patches of suitable habitat over short to medium distances (50\textendash 300 m). Between-patch movements were more likely between patches that were close together. Scrub barriers reduced dispersal. 4 The probability of dispersal between two recaptures depended on the length of the time interval between them. Coenagrion mercuriale performed considerable between-patch movements within a small fraction (1\textendash 2 days) of its mean mature adult life span (7\textendash 8 days). 5 Qualitative comparison of field colonization distances measured here and distances between UK sites occupied by C. mercuriale revealed that empty sites within large clusters of sites would probably be recolonized rapidly and dispersal events would be frequent. However, such events would occur rarely within small isolated sites or clusters of sites, leaving local populations prone to extinction. 6 Synthesis and applications. These data show that management effort should be directed towards maximizing the likelihood of C. mercuriale recolonizing sites naturally within 1\textendash 3 km of other populations (particularly within large clusters). Scrub boundaries should be removed between existing populations and empty, but suitable, sites to facilitate stepping-stone dispersal movements.},

  abstract = {Sustaining ecosystem services (ES), mitigating their tradeoffs and avoiding unfavorable future trajectories are pressing social-environmental challenges that require enhanced understanding of their relationships across scales. Current knowledge of ES relationships is often constrained to one spatial scale or one snapshot in time. In this research, we integrated biophysical modeling with future scenarios to examine changes in relationships among eight ES indicators from 2001\textendash 2070 across three spatial scales\textemdash grid cell, subwatershed, and watershed. We focused on the Yahara Watershed (Wisconsin) in the Midwestern United States\textemdash an exemplar for many urbanizing agricultural landscapes. Relationships among ES indicators changed over time; some relationships exhibited high interannual variations (e.g. drainage vs. food production, nitrate leaching vs. net ecosystem exchange) and even reversed signs over time (e.g. perennial grass production vs. phosphorus yield). Robust patterns were detected for relationships among some regulating services (e.g. soil retention vs. water quality) across three spatial scales, but other relationships lacked simple scaling rules. This was especially true for relationships of food production vs. water quality, and drainage vs. number of days with runoff {$>$}10 mm, which differed substantially across spatial scales. Our results also showed that local tradeoffs between food production and water quality do not necessarily scale up, so reducing local tradeoffs may be insufficient to mitigate such tradeoffs at the watershed scale. We further synthesized these cross-scale patterns into a typology of factors that could drive changes in ES relationships across scales: (1) effects of biophysical connections, (2) effects of dominant drivers, (3) combined effects of biophysical linkages and dominant drivers, and (4) artificial scale effects, and concluded with management implications. Our study highlights the importance of taking a dynamic perspective and accounting for spatial scales in monitoring and management to sustain future ES.},

  abstract = {The management of the habitat of insectivorous species often targets increasing the availability of arthropod prey. However, this may be hindered by lack of knowledge of the mechanisms that determine food availability for insectivores. Prey abundance is often used as a surrogate for availability, but this may be incorrect wherever habitat factors limit access to prey. Ground vegetation clutter is likely to be such a limiting factor for ground foraging insectivorous bats, and we investigated this possibility using Myotis myotis as a model. We performed captivity experiments to determine how ground vegetation density affects foraging. Bats were provided with crickets hidden in sparse, medium and dense grass cover. In addition, we used bat radio tracking data, prey abundance measurements, and geographic information system (GIS) modelling to determine if clutter influences how bats select foraging areas in a Mediterranean region. The experiments demonstrated that ground vegetation clutter greatly reduces access to prey, affecting both capture success and time to capture. Bats detected prey in the dense vegetation, but did not attempt to capture them or did so only after a prolonged delay. Their attempts often failed, because the bats landed over prey with open wings, presumably to increase the catching surface, and the dense vegetation prevented them from reaching the ground. In the study area, cover types with the densest ground vegetation harboured the most prey, but clutter made access to prey by M. myotis difficult. Corroborating this, the GIS models showed that bats avoided foraging in habitats with high prey abundance but in which availability was decreased by dense ground vegetation. Ungrazed grasslands reach vegetation densities that limit access to prey by ground foraging bats, as observed in the study area. However, grazing by cattle reduced clutter to levels equivalent to the sparse treatment in our captive experiments, in which bats captured prey easily. Synthesis and applications. Conservation of ground foraging bats may require the management of their feeding grounds, to increase or maintain prey availability, particularly near important colonies. While dense ground vegetation may promote prey density, it dramatically reduces access to prey and usage by bats; hence, this should be considered by managers. Moderate grazing can be used to reduce ground vegetation cover to levels that permit foraging by bats. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Authors.

These assessments are often limited by data, however, a gap with tremendous potential to be filled through Earth observations (EO), which produce a variety of data across spatial and temporal extents and resolutions. Despite widespread recognition of this potential, in practice few ecosystem service studies use EO. Here, we identify challenges and opportunities to using EO in ecosystem service modeling and assessment. Some challenges are technical, related to data awareness, processing, and access. These challenges require systematic investment in model platforms and data management. Other challenges are more conceptual but still systemic; they are byproducts of the structure of existing ecosystem service models and addressing them requires scientific investment in solutions and tools applicable to a wide range of models and approaches. We also highlight new ways in which EO can be leveraged for ecosystem service assessments, identifying promising new areas of research. More widespread use of EO for ecosystem service assessment will only be achieved if all of these types of challenges are addressed. This will require non-traditional funding and partnering opportunities from private and public agencies to promote data exploration, sharing, and archiving. Investing in this integration will be reflected in better and more accurate ecosystem service assessments worldwide.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, dispersal of aquatic invertebrates has been thought to be very closely associated with river network structure, despite many species being capable of active or passive dispersal across the terrestrial matrix. However, recent studies of both population genetics and community structure from dryland regions indicate that aquatic species commonly disperse across catchments, implying that movement away from streams is more common than originally thought. This study investigated how aquatic invertebrate metacommunity structure in central Australia is influenced by interactions between species' dispersal traits, dispersal routes and local environmental conditions. We sampled community composition in 16 perennial and long-term inundated freshwater habitats in central Australia. Aquatic invertebrate taxa were allocated to one of four dispersal trait groups: obligate aquatic, passive aerial, weak flying and strong flying. We then used Mantel tests to examine correlations between trait group community dissimilarities, and four isolation models representing (i) local environmental conditions, (ii) geographical distances, (iii) landscape resistances restricted to river networks and (iv) landscape resistances incorporating overland dispersal `conduits'. We found that the community composition of aquatic invertebrates in three of four dispersal trait groups, and all traits combined, was influenced primarily by topographic connectivity via overland dispersal conduits. Our results suggest that rainfall events and their effect on the landscape as a whole, rather than river flow during these events, shape aquatic invertebrate metacommunity structure in central Australia. This study provides further support for the importance of overland dispersal conduits to aquatic invertebrates, particularly in arid environments with irregular rainfall.},

  abstract = {Temperament describes the idea that individual behavioural differences are repeatable over time and across situations. This common phenomenon covers numerous traits, such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty, willingness to take risks, exploration, and sociality. The study of temperament is central to animal psychology, behavioural genetics, pharmacology, and animal husbandry, but relatively few studies have examined the ecology and evolution of temperament traits. This situation is surprising, given that temperament is likely to exert an important influence on many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, and that individual variation in temperament appears to be pervasive amongst animal species. Possible explanations for this neglect of temperament include a perceived irrelevance, an insufficient understanding of the link between temperament traits and fitness, and a lack of coherence in terminology with similar traits often given different names, or different traits given the same name. We propose that temperament can and should be studied within an evolutionary ecology framework and provide a terminology that could be used as a working tool for ecological studies of temperament. Our terminology includes five major temperament trait categories: shyness-boldness, explorationavoidance, activity, sociability and aggressiveness. This terminology does not make inferences regarding underlying dispositions or psychological processes, which may have restrained ecologists and evolutionary biologists from working on these traits. We present extensive literature reviews that demonstrate that temperament traits are heritable, and linked to fitness and to several other traits of importance to ecology and evolution. Furthermore, we describe ecologically relevant measurement methods and point to several ecological and evolutionary topics that would benefit from considering temperament, such as phenotypic plasticity, conservation biology, population sampling, and invasion biology.},

  abstract = {Eddy covariance and sapflow data from three Mediterranean ecosystems were analysed via top-down approaches in conjunction with a mechanistic ecosystem gas-exchange model to test current assumptions about drought effects on ecosystem respiration and canopy CO2/H2O exchange. The three sites include two nearly monospecific Quercus ilex L. forests - one on karstic limestone (Pu\'echabon), the other on fluvial sand with access to ground water (Castelporziano) - and a typical mixed macchia on limestone (Arca di No\`e). Estimates of ecosystem respiration were derived from light response curves of net ecosystem CO2 exchange. Subsequently, values of ecosystem gross carbon uptake were computed from eddy covariance CO2 fluxes and estimates of ecosystem respiration as a function of soil temperature and moisture. Bulk canopy conductance was calculated by inversion of the Penman-Monteith equation. In a top-down analysis, it was shown that all three sites exhibit similar behaviour in terms of their overall response to drought. In contrast to common assumptions, at all sites ecosystem respiration revealed a decreasing temperature sensitivity (Q10) in response to drought. Soil temperature and soil water content explained 70-80\% of the seasonal variability of ecosystem respiration. During the drought, light-saturated ecosystem gross carbon uptake and day-time averaged canopy conductance declined by up to 90\%. These changes were closely related to soil water content. Ecosystem water-use efficiency of gross carbon uptake decreased during the drought, regardless whether evapotranspiration from eddy covariance or transpiration from sapflow had been used for the calculation. We evidence that this clearly contrasts current models of canopy function which predict increasing ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE) during the drought. Four potential explanations to those results were identified (patchy stomatal closure, changes in physiological capacities of photosynthesis, decreases in mesophyll conductance for CO2, and photoinhibition), which will be tested in a forthcoming paper. It is suggested to incorporate the new findings into current biogeochemical models after further testing as this will improve estimates of climate change effects on (semi)arid ecosystems' carbon balances.},

Nature provides pollination of nutritious crops, purification of drinking water, protection from floods, and climate security, among other well-studied health benefits. A crucial, yet challenging, research frontier is clarifying how nature promotes physical activity for its many mental and physical health benefits, particularly in densely populated cities with scarce and dwindling access to nature. Here we frame this frontier by conceptually developing a spatial decision-support tool that shows where, how, and for whom urban nature promotes physical activity, to inform urban greening efforts and broader health assessments. We synthesize what is known, present a model framework, and detail the model steps and data needs that can yield generalizable spatial models and an effective tool for assessing the urban nature\textendash physical activity relationship. Current knowledge supports an initial model that can distinguish broad trends and enrich urban planning, spatial policy, and public health decisions. New, iterative research and application will reveal the importance of different types of urban nature, the different subpopulations who will benefit from it, and nature's potential contribution to creating more equitable, green, livable cities with active inhabitants.},

  abstract = {Managing multiple ecosystem services (ES), including addressing trade-offs between services and preventing ecological surprises, is among the most pressing areas for sustainability research. These challenges require ES research to go beyond the currently common approach of snapshot studies limited to one or two services at a single point in time. We used a spatiotemporal approach to examine changes in nine ES and their relationships from 1971 to 2006 across 131 municipalities in a mixed-use landscape in Quebec, Canada. We show how an approach that incorporates time and space can improve our understanding of ES dynamics. We found an increase in the provision of most services through time; however, provision of ES was not uniformly enhanced at all locations. Instead, each municipality specialized in providing a bundle (set of positively correlated ES) dominated by just a few services. The trajectory of bundle formation was related to changes in agricultural policy and global trends; local biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics explained the bundles' increasing spatial clustering. Relationships between services varied through time, with some provisioning and cultural services shifting from a trade-off or no relationship in 1971 to an apparent synergistic relationship by 2006. By implementing a spatiotemporal perspective on multiple services, we provide clear evidence of the dynamic nature of ES interactions and contribute to identifying processes and drivers behind these changing relationships. Our study raises questions about using snapshots of ES provision at a single point in time to build our understanding of ES relationships in complex and dynamic social-ecological systems.},

Today this landscape appears highly fragmented due to agricultural activities such as rice cultivation, extensive cattle farming, and forest plantations. Studies have shown that the Pampa biome has high levels of biodiversity and endemism, but with regard to invertebrates, this biome is still one of the least known in Brazil. We therefore designed a study comparing the dragonfly (Odonata) communities to environmental and landscape features in this area, measuring diversity by species richness, relative abundance and Shannon index. Our results showed that the Pampa is a biome very rich in odonates, and that the species communities are highly dependent on the environmental conditions of the area. Habitats such as Rivers/Streams, bordered by native grasslands and riparian forests, were shown to harbour communities that were ecologically more complex and sensitive than other habitat types. Man-made lakes and agricultural areas displayed lower levels of biodiversity and odonate communities dominated by generalist species. By combining data on the communities of Odonata and other taxa, our analyses may be instrumental in determining priority areas for future conservation measures within the area.},

We modelled these lynx productivity data with snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus Erxleben, 1777) population attributes using seven multiple a priori competing hypotheses. Hare abundance showed peak, decline, and increase phases, and densities based on capture\textendash mark\textendash recapture estimates ranged from 0.11 to 1.19 hares{$\cdot$}ha-1. Overall, yearling pregnancy rate was 23.5\% and the model with hare abundance fitted alone had the most support. However, surprisingly hare abundance explained little (6\%) variation in yearling pregnancy rate. Mean ({$\pm$}SE) litter size was 3.51 {$\pm$} 0.27. None of our covariate models provided unequivocal support for predicting yearling litter size. We speculate that individuals may exhibit behavioural plasticity such that they can dampen the impact of primary prey abundance on yearling pregnancy rate by exploiting alternate prey. Furthermore, intraspecific social interactions may provide additional insight into the determinants of pregnancy rate in yearling lynx.},

Nevertheless, this complex concept is still surrounded by uncertainty and confusion, largely due to the separation between structural and func- tional connectivity. Amphibians are the most threa- tened vertebrates around the globe, in Europe mostly due to habitat alteration, and to their particular life cycle. Pond breeding amphibians are considered to be organised in metapopulations, enhancing the impor- tance of landscape connectivity in this group of animals. We sampled the amphibian species present in two pond groups in Central Western Spain. We applied the graph theory framework to these two pond networks in order to determine the importance of each pond for the entire network connectivity. We related the pond importance for connectivity with the species richness present in each pond. We tested if connec- tivity (partially) determined the presence of the amphibian species sampled using logistic regression. The results show that the structural connectivity of the pond network impacts on the amphibian species richness pattern and that the importance of the pond for the connectivity of the network is an important factor for the presence of some species. Our results, hence, attest the importance of (structural) landscape connectivity determining the pattern of amphibian (functional) colonization in discrete ponds.},

Patch isolation, a crucial parameter to the predictions of island biogeography and metapopulation theories, is measured by distance alone. To test whether the type of interpatch matrix can contribute significantly to patch isolation, I conducted a mark-recapture study on a butterfly community inhabiting meadows in a naturally patchy landscape. I used maximum likelihood to estimate the relative resistances of the two major matrix types (willow thicket and conifer forest) to butterfly movement between meadow patches. For four of the six butterfly taxa (subfamilies or tribes) studied, conifer was 3-12 times more resistant than willow. For the two remaining taxa (the most vagile and least vagile in the community), resistance estimates for willow and conifer were not significantly different, indicating that responses to matrix differ even among closely related species. These results suggest that the surrounding matrix can significantly influence the "effective isolation" of habitat patches, rendering them more or less isolated than simple distance or classic models would indicate. Modification of the matrix may provide opportunities for reducing patch isolation and thus the extinction risk of populations in fragmented landscapes.},

  abstract = {Citation: Rinehart, S., and D. Hawlena. 2020. The effects of predation risk on prey stoichiometry: a meta-analysis. Ecology 00(00): Abstract. A decade ago, the general stress paradigm (GSP) aimed to develop a predictive framework linking predator effects to ecosystem function. The GSP was based on the notion that animals, across taxa, exhibit similar physiological responses to predation risk that divert resources from growth and reproduction (which require N-rich biomolecules [i.e., protein]) to emergency functions (which require C-rich biomolecules [e.g., carbohydrates]). The GSP predicts that stressed prey should have a greater dietary demand for C-rich resources, a higher body C:N ratio, and elevated N excretion. Now, 10 yr later, we aim to revisit the GSP-using quantitative meta-analysis to test the original predictions of the GSP and how (1) predator hunting mode, (2) multiple stressors, and (3) prey dietary shifts affect prey stoichiometric responses to predation risk. Our data set was consistent with previous work showing that pre-dation risk increases prey glucocorticoid levels and metabolic rates and decreases prey growth rates. We found that predation risk tended to decrease the fat, carbohydrate, and protein content of prey bodies; increased the C:P and N:P of prey bodies; but had no effect on the C, N, P, or C:N content of prey bodies. Additionally, we found no effect of predation risk on the N content of prey excretions. Prey responses to predation risk were unaffected by multiple stressors or the prey's ability to shift their diet, but predator hunting mode did affect the nature of prey stoichiometric responses. Specifically, ambush predators decreased prey macronutrient content and suppressed prey growth, and active predators had no effect on prey macronutrient content and a smaller effect on prey growth than ambush predators. The significant effects of predation risk were supported by robust fail-safe numbers, despite the high between-comparison hetero-geneity that was found in all analyses. Our findings highlight the need (1) to test the underlying mechanisms and emerging patterns of the GSP in diverse taxa, (2) to explore the mismatch between prey macronutrient content and elemental stoichiometry, and (3) to expand the conceptual framework to include more inducible defenses (e.g., behavioral and morphological) and predator traits.},

Ecological stoichiometry studies the elemental balance of ecological processes and offers a uniquely quantitative, transferrable way to assess food quality using elemental ratios, e.g., carbon (C):nitrogen (N). Here, we test whether snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) vary their home range size in response to spatial patterns of C:N, C:phosphorus (P), and N:P ratios of two preferred boreal forage species, lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) and red maple (Acer rubrum), in summer months. Boreal forests are N- and P-limited ecosystems and access to N- and P-rich forage is paramount to snowshoe hares' survival. Accordingly, we consider forage with higher C content relative to N and P to be lower quality than forage with lower relative C content. We combine elemental distribution models with summer home range size estimates to test the hypothesis that home range size will be smaller in areas with access to high, homogeneous food quality compared to areas of low, heterogeneous food quality. Our results show snowshoe hares had smaller home ranges in areas where lowbush blueberry foliage quality was higher or more spatially homogenous than in areas of lower, more heterogeneous food quality. By responding to spatial patterns of food quality, consumers may influence community and ecosystem processes by, for example, varying nutrient recycling rates. Our reductionist biogeochemical approach to viewing resources leads us to holistic insights into consumer spatial ecology.},

One key animal group to clarify this controversy is that of odonate insects (dragonflies and damselflies), given their combined close water-land requirements. We have investigated whether changes in land use impact species richness and composition of odonates from 1980 to 1993 (period I) to 1994\textendash 2010 (period II) in Mexico. The effect of land use changes and land cover changes on species richness was analyzed using multiple diversity measures and at different spatial scales. In period II, an area reduction in original vegetation and increase in land use occurred. Responses to land use varied among spatial scales and measures of diversity but, overall, species richness in the transformed area was higher than in the original vegetation. However, species composition indicated a high species turnover inside hydrologic regions (watersheds) and across land uses classes, particularly between original and secondary vegetation. Our interpretation is that despite high land use conversion in Mexico, adult odonates seem resilient to land use change in terms of species richness, but not in species composition, which is in partial agreement with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Finally, we suggest that hydrologic region scale and use of entropy maximization (HCDT entropy), could provide a reliable biodiversity estimation of species loss associated with land use change.},

Techniques for estimating the distribution and abundance of small mammals are readily available, but methods for identification of life history requisites, particularly habitat requirements, are not well established. Herein we present a protocol suitable for the determination of small mammal distribution and abundance, as well as species-specific habitat requirements. The protocol was developed to assess the influence of alternative timber harvest operations on small mammals in boreal mixedwoods as part of the Canadian Forest Service multidisciplinary research program in the Black Sturgeon Forest of northwestern Ontario. As a result, the methodologies are useful for both the elucidation of basic species-habitat associations and to evaluate the effects of natural and human disturbance on habitat, small mammal distribution and abundance, and biological diversity.},

  abstract = {We show evidence of differential predation on snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) by great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) and ask whether predation mortality is related to antipredator behaviour in prey. We predicted higher predation on (1) young and inexperienced hares, (2) hares in open habitats lacking cover to protect from owl predation, and (3) hares in above average condition assuming that rich food patches are under highest risk of predation. Information on killed hares was obtained at nest sites of owls and by monitoring hares using radio-telemetry. The availability of age classes within the hare population was established from live-trapping and field data on reproduction and survival. Great horned owls preferred juvenile over adult hares. Juveniles were more vulnerable to owl predation before rather than after dispersal, suggesting that displacement or increased mobility were not causes for this increased mortality. Owls killed radio-collared hares more often in open than in closed forest types, and they avoided or had less hunting success in habitats with dense shrub cover. Also, owls took hares in above average condition, although it is unclear whether samples from early spring are representative for other seasons. In conclusion, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that variation in antipredator behaviours of snowshoe hares leads to differential predation by great horned owls.},

We also discuss tradeoffs regarding species selection and local conservation concerns, as well as the central role of human perception in the interpretation of ecosystem services and disservices, particularly the uncritical assertion that `everybody loves trees'.

Since that time WNS has spread throughout the northeastern United States, southeastern Canada, and southwest across Pennsylvania and as far west as Missouri. Suspect WNS cases have been identified in Minnesota and Iowa, and the causative agent of WNS (Pseudogymnoascus destructans) has recently been detected in Mississippi. The impact of WNS is devastating for little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), causing up to 100\% mortality in some overwintering populations, and previous research has forecast the extirpation of the species due to the disease. Recent evidence indicates that remnant populations may persist in areas where WNS is endemic. We developed a spatially explicit model of little brown bat population dynamics to investigate the potential for populations to recover under alternative scenarios. We used these models to investigate how starting population sizes, potential changes in the number of bats overwintering successfully in hibernacula, and potential changes in demographic rates of the population post WNS may influence the ability of the bats to recover to former levels of abundance. We found that populations of the little brown bat and other species that are highly susceptible to WNS are unlikely to return to pre-WNS levels in the near future under any of the scenarios we examined.},

This paper proposes an efficient method for the automated creation of a road-side tree inventory using Mobile Terrestrial Lidar System (MTLS) point clouds. In the proposed method ground points are filtered through preprocessing to reduce processing time. Next, tree trunks are detected by performing a Hough Transform (HT) algorithm on several generated raster images from the point clouds. By initiating an approximate area of a tree's foliage through a Voronoi Tessellation (VT) algorithm, the accurate boundary of the foliage is identified by applying Active Contour (AC) models. By extracting the points within this foliage boundary the geometric characteristics of each tree are obtained. This method was evaluated with two sample point clouds from different MTLS systems, and the algorithm correctly extracted all of the trees from both datasets. Addi\- tionally, comparing the calculated parameters with manually observed measures, the accuracy of the obtained geometric parameters were promising.},

  abstract = {Urban tree planting initiatives are being actively promoted as a planning tool to enable urban areas to adapt to and mitigate against climate change, enhance urban sustainability and improve human health and well-being. However, opportunities for creating new areas of green space within cities are often limited and tree planting initiatives may be constrained to kerbside locations. At this scale, the net impact of trees on human health and the local environment is less clear, and generalised approaches for evaluating their impact are not well developed. In this review, we use an urban ecosystems services framework to evaluate the direct, and locally-generated, ecosystems services and disservices provided by street trees. We focus our review on the services of major importance to human health and well-being which include `climate regulation', `air quality regulation' and `aesthetics and cultural services'. These are themes that are commonly used to justify new street tree or street tree retention initiatives. We argue that current scientific understanding of the impact of street trees on human health and the urban environment has been limited by predominantly regional-scale reductionist approaches which consider vegetation generally and/or single out individual services or impacts without considering the wider synergistic impacts of street trees on urban ecosystems. This can lead planners and policymakers towards decision making based on single parameter optimisation strategies which may be problematic when a single intervention offers different outcomes and has multiple effects and potential trade-offs in different places. We suggest that a holistic approach is required to evaluate the services and disservices provided by street trees at different scales. We provide information to guide decision makers and planners in their attempts to evaluate the value of vegetation in their local setting. We show that by ensuring that the specific aim of the intervention, the scale of the desired biophysical effect and an awareness of a range of impacts guide the choice of i) tree species, ii) location and iii) density of tree placement, street trees can be an important tool for urban planners and designers in developing resilient and resourceful cities in an era of climatic change.},

Obligate aquatic and amphibiotic insects readily inhabit novel water bodies, as many possess mobility traits for opportunistic colonization. We review here the value of artificial ponds (\textbackslash{} 2 ha) (and reservoirs;[ 2 ha) for local aquatic insect diversity in mostly dry and drought-prone southern Africa. We compare these ponds to natural pools, wetlands, and stream deposition pools. The region has a highly varied topography and physiographical zones. Flat, arid areas largely support widespread insect generalists, while the mountainous orographic zones support an additional rich fauna of localized endemics. However, the many ponds ([ 0.5 million) have greatly changed the local distribution patterns of surface freshwater across the region, increasing the area of occupancy for many aquatic insect species, especially dragonflies. We focus on the extent to which aquatic insect assemblages have benefitted from new ponds and reservoirs. We conclude that these novel ecosystems benefit almost all lentic aquatic insect species, while also enabling population resilience during droughts. However, while these benefits are substantial, these ponds are not a substitute for natural still waters, which are still required to maintain all indigenous lentic aquatic insect diversity.},

  abstract = {1. Climate models predict more extreme weather in Mediterranean ecosystems, with more frequent drought periods and torrential rainfall. These expected changes may affect major process in ecosystems such as mineral cycling. However, there is a lack of experimental data regarding the effects of prolonged drought on nutrient cycling and content in Mediterranean ecosystems. 2. A 6-year drought manipulation experiment was conducted in a Quercus ilex Mediterranean forest. The aim was to investigate the effects of drought conditions expected to occur over the coming decades, on the contents and concentrations of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in stand biomass, and P and K content and availability in soils. 3. Drought (an average reduction of 15\% in soil moisture) increased P leaf concentration by 18.2\% and reduced P wood and root concentrations (30.9\% and 39.8\%, respectively) in the dominant tree species Quercus ilex, suggesting a process of mobilization of P from wood towards leaves. The decrease in P wood concentrations in Quercus ilex, together with a decrease in forest biomass growth, led to an overall decrease (by approximately one-third) of the total P content in above-ground biomass. In control plots, the total P content in the above-ground biomass increased 54 kg ha-1 from 1999 to 2005, whereas in drought plots there was no increase in P levels in above-ground biomass. Drought had no effects on either K above-ground contents or concentrations. 4. Drought increased total soil soluble P by increasing soil soluble organic P, which is the soil soluble P not directly available to plant capture. Drought reduced the ratio of soil soluble inorganic P : soil soluble organic P by 50\% showing a decrease of inorganic P release from P bound to organic matter. Drought increased by 10\% the total K content in the soil, but reduced the soil soluble K by 20.4\%. 5. Drought led to diminished plant uptake of mineral nutrients and to greater recalcitrance of minerals in soil. This will lead to a reduction in P and K in the ecosystem, due to losses in P and K through leaching and erosion, if the heavy rainfalls predicted by IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) models occur. As P is currently a limiting factor in many Mediterranean terrestrial ecosystems, and given that P and K are necessary for high water-use efficiency and stomata control, the negative effects of drought on P and K content in the ecosystem may well have additional indirect negative effects on plant fitness. \textcopyright{} 2007 The Authors.},

This study examined the nutrient concentrations of tree leaves in 3530 plots of the Catalonian Forest Inventory. Catalonia is a Mediterra-nean region located in NE Iberian Peninsula. It has a long land-use history and includes the large industrial urban area of Barcelona but still contains a large forest area (42\%). In the forests of Catalonia, leaf nutrient concentration increased and leaf C:nutrient ratios decreased from south to north, which paral-leled the increase in MAP (mean annual precipitation) and the decrease in MAT (mean annual temperature), which was expected in a Mediterranean climate where the availability of water is the most limiting factor for plant nutrient uptake. In addition, the availability of water, which influences productivity, was associated with low leaf N:P content ratios, which is consistent with the Growth Rate Hypothesis. At a regional scale, the results support the Soil-Age Hypothesis because the youngest soils in the Pyrenees had the lowest leaf N:P ratios. Furthermore, the type of forest (evergreen, deciduous, or coniferous) explained some of the variation in leaf nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry. Nutrient concentrations were highest in deciduous trees and lowest in coniferous trees. Leaf nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry were mainly correlated with climate, but other factors such as the chemical properties of soil and rock, phylogenetics, and different ecological histories and anthropogenic factors such as pollution , had an effect.},

Methods We tested the relationships of total forest nutrient content, stoichiom-etry and allocation between leaves and wood in trees with growth along environmental gradients using data from the Catalan Forest Inventory and a suite of multivariate mixed models, ANOVAs and principal components analyses. Results The aboveground growth of trees and the nutrient content of leaves and wood were positively correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP). The changes in C:nutrient ratios were proportionally higher in leaves than in wood, mainly in deciduous forests. Higher MAP was also related to a lower N:P content ratio in leaves and wood but was not related to a greater allocation of P than N in leaves relative to wood (N:PL/W). Conifers, which presented the highest relative aboveground growth, had the lowest N:PL/W (0.99 0.02), whereas the slow-growing evergreens had the highest N:PL/W (2.26 0.23). Main conclusions In all forest types, growth was related to a higher allocation of nutrients to leaves than to wood, especially of P, coinciding with better climatic conditions for growth (higher MAP in this Mediterranean context). The highest rates of growth were linked to the lowest N:P ratios. The allocation of P relative to N in leaves is higher in conifers than in evergreen and deciduous trees.},

We studied to what extent elemental stoichiometry in plants might be strongly related to environmental drivers and competition from coexisting species. Location: Europe. Methods: We analysed foliar N, P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations and their ratios among 50 species of European forest trees sampled in 5284 plots across Europe and their relationships with phylogeny, forest type, current climate and N deposition. Results: Phylogeny is strongly related to overall foliar elemental composition in European tree species. Species identity explained 56.7\% of the overall foliar elemental composition and stoichiometry. Forest type and current climatic conditions also partially explained the differences in foliar elemental composition among species. In the same genus co-occurring species had overall higher differences in foliar elemental composition and stoichiometry than the non-co-occurring species. Main conclusions: The different foliar elemental compositions among species are related to phylogenetic distances, but they are also related to current climatic conditions, forest types, drivers of global change such as atmospheric N deposition, and to differences among co-occurring species as a probable consequence of niche specialization to reduce direct competition for the same resources. Different species have their own 'fixed' foliar elemental compositions but retain some degree of plasticity to the current climatic and competitive conditions. A wider set of elements beyond N and P better represent the biogeochemical niche and are highly sensitive to plant function. Foliar elemental composition can thus be useful for representing important aspects of plant species niches.},

Using data for 4691 forest plots from across Spain, we tested the following hypotheses: (i) that foliar sto-ichiometries of forest trees are strongly influenced by phylogeny, (ii) that climate, as an important driver of plant uptake and nutrient use efficiency, affects foliar stoichiometry, (iii) that long-term loads of N influence N, P and K concentrations and ratios in natural vegetation, and (iv) that sympatric species are differentiated according to their foliar stoichiometry, thereby reducing the intensity of resource competition. Our analyses revealed that several factors contributed to interspecific variation in elemental composition and stoichiometry. These included phylogeny, forest type, climate, N deposition, and competitive neighborhood relationships (probably related to niche segregation effect). These findings support the notion that foliar elemental composition reflects adaptation both to regional factors such as climate and to local factors such as competition with co-occurring species.},

  abstract = {Several studies published in the recent past have shown that rising levels of thyroid disrupting chemicals (TDCs) in the environment affect thyroid function in humans. These TDCs are the anthropogenic organic compounds that enter the human body mostly by ingestion and may trigger autoimmune thyroiditis, the most common cause of hypothyroidism. The studies also show the presence of high levels of TDCs in marine animals; therefore, consumption of contaminated seafood might trigger hypothyroidism. So far, there is no readily available population-based data, showing the regional distribution of hypothyroidism cases. We collected administrative data from the Newfoundland and Labrador Centre for Health Information on hospitalizations with hypothyroid-ism (from 1998 to 2012) in 41 coastal communities of Newfoundland and found that mean hypothyroidism rates of west and south coasts were significantly higher than in the east coast (1.8 and 1.9 times respectively). A one-way analysis of variance was used to test for regional differences in rates. A significant between-group difference in the rate of hypothyroidism was found (F 2,38 = 8.309; p = 0.001). The St. Lawrence River, its estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence are heavily polluted with TDCs from industries, their effluents, and urbanization in the Great Lakes Watershed and along the river. Environment Canada has already identified this river along with the Great Lakes Watershed as one of the top TDCs polluted water sources in the country. The west and south coasts are in contact with the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Local marine products are a regular diet of the coastal communities of New-foundland. Based on these available evidence, we hypothesize the role of TDCs in the rise of hypothyroidism on the western and southern coasts. However, further study will be needed to establish any association between abnormally high rates of hypothyroidism and exposure to TDCs.},

However, in highly dynamic systems with varying local environmental conditions and patch connectivity, communities are likely to experience temporal shifts in their assembly mechanisms. Here, we used a set of perennial (PR) and intermittent (IR) rivers to assess if assembly mechanisms vary seasonally in response to flow intermittence. Location Mediterranean climate region (100,000 km2), Spain. Methods We used a modelling approach to assess the relative effect of environmental sorting and dispersal-based processes on aquatic invertebrate metacommunities within and across river types at four distinct hydrological periods. We used local environmental variables to assess environmental sorting, and considered geographical, network and topographical distances as different dispersal surrogates. Linear mixed effect models accounting for the non-independence of pairwise distances were used to assess the relationships between community dissimilarity and distance matrices. Results Assembly mechanisms were more temporally stable in PR than in IR. In PR, community dissimilarities were equally related to environmental and geographical distances suggesting codominance of species sorting and dispersal-based assembly mechanisms. In IR, environmental distance best explained community dissimilarities during the dry period when flow cessation imposes strong environmental sorting, whereas metacommunity organization was much more stochastic during the rewetting period when high flows may randomly reorganize communities. Dispersal processes dominated assembly mechanisms between PR and IR during the rewetting period suggesting an increase in recolonization processes linking both river types following the dry period. Geographical and topographical distances best explained community variability, suggesting that overland dispersal dominates in river networks fragmented by drying events. Main conclusions Aquatic invertebrate metacommunity assembly mechanisms vary seasonally in response to changes in hydrological conditions. The temporal dimension should be better incorporated into metacommunity studies in highly dynamic systems such as intermittent rivers.},

We show that variation in desert soil P availability is linked to abundance of an insect herbivore (Sabinia setosa through the influence of soil P on the C:P ratio of the host plant (Prosopis velutina ). Low P availability increases C:P ratio of Prosopis leaves, leading to a decline in body \%P, \%RNA and abundance of Sabinia . Tight association between soil, plant and herbivore P provides the first evidence of a mechanistic pathway linking P biogeochemistry to terrestrial food webs by altering the supply of dietary P to herbivores, thus limiting their capacity for growth by constraining the production of P-rich cellular ribosomal RNA (rRNA).},

The emergent structure and heterogeneity of the urban landscape drives the biotic outcomes observed, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies effectively consider structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes, instead focusing on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. We explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships binding social inequities, specifically racism, and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices - including residential segregation - to the observed heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. As a result, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors driving biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct urbanization's biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience to global environmental change.},

This new approach challenges classical niche theory with potentially great ecological consequences , but so far has only scarce empirical support. Here, we investigated if and how consistent inter-individual differences in behavior predict space use and movement patterns in free-ranging bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and thereby contribute to individual niche specialization. Individuals were captured and marked from three different subpopulations in NorthEast Germany. Inter-individual differences in boldness and exploration were quantified via repeated standardized tests directly in the field after capture. Subsequently, space use and movement patterns of a representative sample of the behavioral variation (n = 21 individuals) were monitored via automated VHF telemetry for a period of four days, yielding on average 384 locations per individual. Bolder individuals occupied larger home ranges and core areas (estimated via kernel density analyses), moved longer distances, spatially overlapped with fewer conspecifics and preferred different microhabitats based on vegetation cover compared to shyer individuals. We found evidence for personality-dependent space use, movement, and occupation of individual spatial niches in bank voles. Thus, besides dietary niche specialization also spatial dimensions of ecological niches vary among individuals within populations, which may have important consequences for ecological interactions within-and between species.},

These foragers harvest crustacean prey from a variety of benthic algal substrata. In field environments, patch types vary in two ways. First, substrata differ in structural complexity and probably afford different degrees of protection from predators. Second, substratum types vary in prey richness. There was no correlation between structural complexity and prey richness, and either or both factors could be a component of foraging patch value. Each patch is small and individual foragers are simultaneously confronted with arrays of patches encompassing the full range of variation in structure and prey richness. Furthermore, a major predator of young-of-year black surfperch, the kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus (Girard), is patchily distributed in space and time. Thus similar arrays of patch types can be characterized by different levels of overall risk. Risk to foragers is dependent on light level as well as the presence and density of predators. The interplay between food quality and shelter potential in influencing patch choice was examined under different regimes of risk. Both laboratory and field experiments indicated patch preference was based primarily on food quality. However, the physical structure of a patch did become a component of patch choice as risk increased. The relative value of physical structure under high risk was dependent on the prey richness of a patch; food-poor substrata with high shelter potential remained unfavored even in situations of high risk.},

This view, however, is incomplete because it does not acknowledge that predators may play a significant role in the delivery of critical life-support services such as ecosystem nutrient cycling. New research is beginning to show that predator effects on nutrient cycling are ubiquitous. These effects emerge from direct nutrient excretion, egestion or translocation within and across ecosystem boundaries after prey consumption, and from indirect effects mediated by predator interactions with prey. Depending on their behavioural ecology, predators can create heterogeneous or homogeneous nutrient distributions across natural landscapes. Because predator species are disproportionately vulnerable to elimination from ecosystems, we stand to lose much more from their disappearance than their simple charismatic attractiveness.},

We conducted a review of stud-ies published between 1990 and May 2017 that examined urban biodiversity ecosystem service (BES) relationships. In total, we reviewed 317 publications and found biodiversity and UES metrics mentioned 944 times. Only 228 (24\%) of the 944 mentions were empirically tested. Among these, 119 (52\%) demon-strated a positive BES relationship. Our review showed that taxonomic metrics were used most often as proxies for biodiversity, with very little attention given to functional biodiversity metrics. Similarly, the role of particular species, including non-natives, and specific functional traits are understudied. Finally, we found a paucity of empirical evidence underpinning urban BES relationships. As urban planners increasingly incorporate UES delivery consideration to their decision-making, researchers need to address these substantial knowledge gaps to allow potential trade-offs and synergies between biodiver-sity conservation and the promotion of UES to be adequately accounted for.},

The sporadic availability and diversity of resources can create highly dynamic systems. This is especially true in agro-ecological landscapes where the dynamic interplay of insect movement and heterogeneous landscapes hampers prediction of their spatio-temporal dynamics and population size. Objectives: We therefore systematically looked at population-level consequences of different movement strategies in temporally-dynamic resource landscapes for an insect species whose movement strategy is slightly understood: the Queensland Fruit Fly (Bactrocera tryoni) Methods: We developed a spatially-explicit model to predict changes in population dynamics and sizes in response to varying resources across a landscape. We simulated the temporal dynamics of fruit trees as the main resource using empirical fruiting dates. Movement strategies were derived from general principles and varied in directedness of movement and movement trigger. Results: We showed that temporal continuity in resource availability was the main contributing factor for large and persistent populations. This explicitly included presence of continuous low-density resources such as fruit trees in urban areas. Analysing trapping data from SE Australia supported this finding. We also found strong effects of movement strategies, with directed movement supporting higher population densities. Conclusions: These results give insight into structuring processes of spatial population dynamics of Queensland Fruit Fly in realistic and complex food production landscapes, but can also be extended to other systems. Such mechanistic understanding will help to improve forecasting of spatio-temporal hotspots and bottlenecks and will, in the end, enable more targeted population management.},

Practices for reporting positionality vary widely and rarely incorporate a nuanced discussion of the impact of demographic identities on research. Researchers holding marginalized or relatively hidden identities must navigate additional layers regarding transparency of their positionality. Purpose We identify ways in which positionality impacts research, with a particular emphasis on demographic identity dimensions. We note that whether identities are relatively marginalized, privileged, hidden, or apparent in a research context creates complexities for conceptualizing, practicing, and disclosing one's positionality. Method In a collaborative inquiry informed by autoethnography, we assemble positionality reflections of current engineering education researchers to demonstrate the primary ways in which positionality impacts research. Results We find that positionality impacts six fundamental aspects of research: research topic, epistemology, ontology, methodology, relation to participants, and communication. These aspects of research delve deeper than conceptions of positionality as a methodological limitation, a measure to prevent bias, or a requirement for research quality. Conclusion The impact of positionality on research is complex, particularly when researchers occupy minoritized identities and for research topics that interrogate power relations between identity groups. By demonstrating the practices of interrogating and representing positionality, we hope to encourage more researchers to represent positionality transparently, thus making researchers' transparency safer for all. We argue that positionality is an important tool for reflecting on and dislocating privilege, particularly when working on equity research.},

To effectively plan restoration programs information is required on how the landscape context of revegetation influences biodiversity gains. Here, we investigate the relative influence of patch area and connectivity on bird species richness and abundance within urban revegetation patches in Brisbane, Australia. We carried out bird surveys at 20 revegetation sites, and used hierarchical partitioning and model selection to test the relative importance of patch area (the area of revegetation including all directly connected remnant vegetation) and landscape connectivity (the vegetated area connected by less than 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m and 50 m cleared gaps). We controlled for a number of possible confounding variables within the hierarchical partitioning procedure. Both the hierarchical partitioning and model selection procedures indicated that connectivity had an important influence on bird species richness. Patch area in combination with connectivity were important influencing factors on overall bird abundance. We also carried out the hierarchical partitioning procedure for bird abundance data within a range of feeding guilds, yielding results specific to species groups. Overall our data suggest that greater connectivity enhances the habitat area that colonists can arrive from (resulting in greater species richness), whereas increased patch area allows for increased abundance by expanding the habitat available to species already present in a patch. A combined approach where connectivity and overall habitat area is enhanced across the landscape is likely to be necessary to meet long-term conservation objectives.},

  abstract = {Improved understanding of the nutritional ecology of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is important in understanding how tropical forests maintain high productivity on low-fertility soils. Relatively little is known about how AM fungi will respond to changes in nutrient inputs in tropical forests, which hampers our ability to assess how forest productivity will be influenced by anthropogenic change. Here we assessed the influence of long-term inorganic and organic nutrient additions and nutrient depletion on AM fungi, using two adjacent experiments in a lowland tropical forest in Panama. We characterised AM fungal communities in soil and roots using 454-pyrosequencing, and quantified AM fungal abundance using microscopy and a lipid biomarker. Phosphorus and nitrogen addition reduced the abundance of AM fungi to a similar extent, but affected community composition in different ways. Nutrient depletion (removal of leaf litter) had a pronounced effect on AM fungal community composition, affecting nearly as many OTUs as phosphorus addition. The addition of nutrients in organic form (leaf litter) had little effect on any AM fungal parameter. Soil AM fungal communities responded more strongly to changes in nutrient availability than communities in roots. This suggests that the 'dual niches' of AM fungi in soil versus roots are structured to different degrees by abiotic environmental filters, and biotic filters imposed by the plant host. Our findings indicate that AM fungal communities are fine-tuned to nutrient regimes, and support future studies aiming to link AM fungal community dynamics with ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {1. Prey responses to high predation risk can be morphological or behavioural and ultimately come at the cost of survival, growth, body condition, or reproduction. These sub-lethal predator effects have been shown to be mediated by physiological stress. We tested the hypothesis that elevated glucocorticoid concentrations directly cause a decline in reproduction in individual free-ranging female snowshoe hares, Lepus americanus. We measured the cortisol concentration from each dam (using a faecal analysis enzyme immunoassay) and her reproductive output (litter size, offspring birth mass, offspring right hind foot (RHF) length) 30 h after birth. 2. In a natural monitoring study, we monitored hares during the first and second litter from the population peak (2006) to the second year of the decline (2008). We found that faecal cortisol metabolite (FCM) concentration in dams decreased 52\% from the first to the second litter. From the first to the second litter, litter size increased 122\%, offspring body mass increased 130\%, and offspring RHF length increased 112\%. Dam FCM concentrations were inversely related to litter size (r2 = 0{$\cdot$}19), to offspring birth mass (r2 = 0{$\cdot$}32), and to offspring RHF length (r2 = 0{$\cdot$}64). 3. In an experimental manipulation, we assigned wild-caught, pregnant hares to a control and a stressed group and held them in pens. Hares in the stressed group were exposed to a dog 1\textendash 2 min every other day before parturition to simulate high predation risk. At parturition, unsuccessful-stressed dams (those that failed to give birth to live young) and stressed dams had 837\% and 214\%, respectively, higher FCM concentrations than control dams. Of those females that gave birth, litter size was similar between control and stressed dams. However, offspring from stressed dams were 37\% lighter and 16\% smaller than offspring from control dams. Increasing FCM concentration in dams caused the decline of offspring body mass (r2 = 0{$\cdot$}57) and RHF (r2 = 0{$\cdot$}52). 4. This is the first study in a free-ranging population of mammals to show that elevated, predator-induced, glucocorticoid concentrations in individual dams caused a decline in their reproductive output measured both by number and quality of offspring. Thus, we provide evidence that any stressor, not just predation, which increases glucocorticoid concentrations will result in a decrease in reproductive output.},

  abstract = {The risk of predation can cause strong antipredator behaviors and marked stress-induced changes in physiology. In mothers, predator-induced stress can reduce reproductive fitness and alter offspring phenotypes. Acting via these generational, maternal stress effects, predation risk may continue to influence the demography of prey populations even when the predators are no longer present. The 10-year snowshoe hare cycle is the classic top-down predator-driven example in nature and is caused both by direct mortality and by indirect risk effects. During the decline phase, virtually, all hares die because they are killed and simultaneously hares exhibit pronounced stress effects caused by high predation risk. However, the rapidity of the decline phase varies among cycles. When the decline is extremely rapid, we expect that the risk experienced by hares is much greater than when the decline is prolonged. The enigma of these cycles is the low phase following the decline, when there is little or no population growth in spite of the absence of predators and ample food. Previously, we have shown that predator-induced maternal stress decreases reproduction and compromises the offspring stress axis. Here, we examine how the severity of predation risk during six separate population declines is related to the length of the subsequent low phase. We show that the more severe the decline, as indicated by the greater rate of loss of hares, the longer the subsequent low phase. These results support the hypothesis that the greater the degree of risk, the longer the generational impact on population demography (the longer the low phase of the hare population). Our findings have broad applicability to conservation and management efforts; even when a stressor (predator, human disturbance) is removed or when exposure may be short term (drought, fire or translocation), the signature of the stressor may be evident over several future generations.},

In this study, the seasonal influence of road salt influx on the geochemical cycling of a small, urban kettle lake is examined. Water column samples were collected approximately twice per month for fifteen months and analyzed for temperature, pH, conductivity, major ions, nutrients and redox-sensitive solutes. The lake water column was redox-stratified with high concentrations of dissolved Mn(II), Fe(II), ammonium, phosphate and, during some periods, sulfide and methane in the hypolimnion. Bottom water anoxia was persistent throughout the entire sampling period. Concentrations of sodium and chloride, which correlated strongly with conductivity, were over a hundred times greater compared with levels in nearby rural lakes. Conductivity, chloride and calculated density profiles indicated the presence of a pycnocline at \textasciitilde 9 m depth that persisted throughout the sampling period. The chem-ical data demonstrate that road salt input has caused the lake to become meromictic, with a complete lack of fall and spring turnover.},

  abstract = {Interannual variation of carbon fluxes can be attributed to a number of biotic and abiotic controls that operate at different spatial and temporal scales. Type and frequency of disturbance, forest dynamics, and climate regimes are important sources of variability. Assessing the variability of carbon fluxes from these specific sources can enhance the interpretation of past and current observations. Being able to separate the variability caused by forest dynamics from that induced by climate will also give us the ability to determine if the current observed carbon fluxes are within an expected range or whether the ecosystem is undergoing unexpected change. Sources of interannual variation in ecosystem carbon fluxes from three evergreen ecosystems, a tropical, a temperate coniferous, and a boreal forest, were explored using the simulation model STANDCARB. We identified key processes that introduced variation in annual fluxes, but their relative importance differed among the ecosystems studied. In the tropical site, intrinsic forest dynamics contributed{\~ } 30\% of the total variation in annual carbon fluxes. In the temperate and boreal sites, where many forest processes occur over longer temporal scales than those at the tropical site, climate controlled more of the variation among annual fluxes. These results suggest that climate-related variability affects the rates of carbon exchange differently among sites. Simulations in which temperature, precipitation, and radiation varied from year to year (based on historical records of climate variation) had less net carbon stores than simulations in which these variables were held constant (based on historical records of monthly average climate), a result caused by the functional relationship between temperature and respiration. This suggests that, under a more variable temperature regime, large respiratory pulses may become more frequent and high enough to cause a reduction in ecosystem carbon stores. Our results also show that the variation of annual carbon fluxes poses an important challenge in our ability to determine whether an ecosystem is a source, a sink, or is neutral in regard to CO2 at longer timescales. In simulations where climate change negatively affected ecosystem carbon stores, there was a 20\% chance of committing Type II error, even with 20 years of sequential data. \textcopyright{} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {A behavioral syndrome is a suite of correlated behaviors expressed either within a given behavioral context (e.g., correlations between foraging behaviors in different habitats) or across different contexts (e.g., correlations among feeding, antipredator, mating, aggressive, and dispersal behaviors). For example, some individuals (and genotypes) might be generally more aggressive, more active or bold, while others are generally less aggressive, active or bold. This phenomenon has been studied in detail in humans, some primates, laboratory rodents, and some domesticated animals, but has rarely been studied in other organisms, and rarely examined from an evolutionary or ecological perspective. Here, we present an integrative overview on the potential importance of behavioral syndromes in evolution and ecology. A central idea is that behavioral correlations generate tradeoffs; for example, an aggressive genotype might do well in situations where high aggression is favored, but might be inappropriately aggressive in situations where low aggression is favored (and vice versa for a low aggression genotype). Behavioral syndromes can thereby result in maladaptive behavior in some contexts, and potentially maintain individual variation in behavior in a variable environment. We suggest terminology and methods for studying behavioral syndromes, review examples, discuss evolutionary and proximate approaches for understanding behavioral syndromes, note insights from human personality research, and outline some potentially important ecological implications. Overall, we suggest that behavioral syndromes could play a useful role as an integrative bridge between genetics, experience, neuroendocrine mechanisms, evolution, and ecology.},

A short-coming of macroinvertebrate rapid assessments is that they use higher taxa, and therefore lack taxonomic resolution and species-specific responses. One subset of invertebrate taxa is the Odonata, which as adults, are sensitive indicators of both riparian and river conditions. Yet adult Odonata are not necessarily an umbrella taxon for all other taxa. Therefore, we investigated whether the two metrics of aquatic macroinvertebrate higher taxa and adult odonate species might complement each other, and whether together they provide better clarity on river health and integrity than one subset alone. Results indicated that both metrics provide a similar portrait of large-scale, overall river conditions. At the smaller spatial scale of parts of rivers, Odonata were highly sensitive to riparian vegetation, and much more so than macroinvertebrate higher taxa. Odonate species were more sensitive to vegetation structure than they were to vegetation composition. Landscape context is also important, with the odonate assemblages at point localities being affected by the neighbouring dominant habitat type. Overall, benthic macroinvertebrates and adult Odonata species provide a highly complementary pair of metrics which together provide large spatial scale (river system) and small spatial scale (point localities) information on the impact of stressors such as riparian invasive alien trees. As adult Odonata are easy to sample and are sensitive to disturbance at both small and large spatial scales, they are valuable indicators for rapid assessment of river condition and riparian quality. \textcopyright{} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The book provides broad, but unified, coverage, and the authors integrate the concepts and ideas shared across models and types of data, especially regarding conceptual links between discrete and continuous limited dependent variables. The authors argue that these dependent variables are, if anything, more common throughout the human sciences than the kind that suit linear regression. They cover special cases or extensions of models, estimation methods, model diagnostics, and, of course, software. They also discuss bounded continuous variables, boundary-inflated models, and methods for modeling heteroscedasticity.  Wherever possible, the authors have illustrated concepts, models, and techniques with real or realistic datasets and demonstrations in R and Stata, and each chapter includes several exercises at the end. The illustrations and exercises help readers build conceptual understanding and fluency in using these techniques. At several points the authors bring together material that has been previously scattered across the literature in journal articles, software package documentation files, and blogs.

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Geographical spatial analysis approaches are ideally applied to studies of wildlife habitat use when spatial data, such as telemetry data or spatial ranges, are available. For instance, it is often desirable to quantify spatialetemporal patterns of home ranges, which are typically delineated as polygons and represent areas of habitat that support wildlife functions. Changes to home ranges over time are often presented as variation in mean polygon area. This two-dimensional approach ignores potentially important spatialetemporal characteristics of habitat use, including site fidelity, range contraction, and expansion. Using SpatialeTemporal Analysis of Moving Polygons (STAMP) we examined a set of move-ment data for a subpopulation of adult female grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) for the period from 1999 to 2003 in the Rocky Mountain foothills region of Alberta, Canada. Home range change was quantified over two-year periods and evaluated on the basis of variable offspring dependency (i.e., whether the females had no cubs, cubs-of-the-year (COY), or yearling cubs) and foraging season. Solitary bears showed the greatest amount of home range fidelity, with an increase in range size during the mating season. Female grizzly bears with offspring experienced substantial home range change. Sows with COY had a reduced maternal home range size, especially during mating season, while those with yearling offspring had an increased home range size. The patterns of home range change were consistent with those expected if some combination of mobility and infanticide were the driving ecological mechanisms. We conclude that offspring dependency does not impact the degree of site fidelity but does impact the nature of home range change experienced. We also suggest that the spatialetemporal change in female grizzly home ranges could be used to infer breeding status and as a population monitoring tool.

  abstract = {Despite repeated calls to action, proposals for urban conservation are often met with surprise or scepticism. There remains a pervasive narrative in policy, practice, and the public psyche that urban environments, although useful for engaging people with nature or providing ecosystem services, are of little conservation value. We argue that the tendency to overlook the conservation value of urban environments stems from misconceptions about the ability of native species to persist within cities and towns and that this, in turn, hinders effective conservation action. However, recent scientific evidence shows that these assumptions do not always hold. Although it is generally true that increasing the size, quality, and connectivity of habitat patches will improve the probability that a species can persist, the inverse is not that small, degraded, or fragmented habitats found in urban environments are worthless. In light of these findings we propose updated messages that guide and inspire researchers, practitioners, and decision makers to undertake conservation action in urban environments: consider small spaces, recognize unconventional habitats, test creative solutions, and use science to minimize the impacts of future urban development.},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key parameter in lakes that can affect numerous features, including microbial metabolism, light climate, acidity, and primary production. In an attempt to understand the factors that regulate DOC in lakes, we assembled a large database (7,514 lakes from 6 continents) of DOC concentrations and other parameters that characterize the conditions in the lakes, the catchment, the soil, and the climate. DOC concentrations were in the range 0.1-332 mg L-1, and the median was 5.71 mg L-1. A partial least squares regression explained 48\% of the variability in lake DOC and showed that altitude, mean annual runoff, and precipitation were negatively correlated with lake DOC, while conductivity, soil carbon density, and soil C:N ratio were positively related with lake DOC. A multiple linear regression using altitude, mean annual runoff, and soil carbon density as predictors explained 40\% of the variability in lake DOC. While lake area and drainage ratio (catchment:lake area) were not correlated to lake DOC in the global data set, these two factors explained significant variation of the residuals of the multiple linear regression model in several regional subsets of data. These results suggest a hierarchical regulation of DOC in lakes, where climatic and topographic characteristics set the possible range of DOC concentrations of a certain region, and catchment and lake properties then regulate the DOC concentration in each individual lake. \textcopyright{} 2007. by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

We studied adult dragonfly mortality and behavior associated with roadways for a number of species. Daily mortality rates for dragonflies were estimated from standardized surveys along predetermined lengths of roads. Relative abundance and flight behavior around and across roadways, a potentially important mortality factor, was determined from timed roadside observations. Observed flight behavior provided no evidence that roads act as significant barriers to dispersal for adult dragonflies. Estimated mean number killed ran-ged from 2 to 35 dragonflies/km/day. Species varied greatly in their susceptibility to motor vehicles. Two species (Plathemis lydia and Libellula luctuosa) made up more than 70\% of the dead dragonflies collected, but only represented 14\% and 31\% of live dragonflies observed, respectively. The relatively low flight heights of these two species over roads (typically under 2 m) may explain their susceptibility; however, another common species (Tramea lacerata) also exhibited low flight height but did not experience high mortality, possibly because of its increased flight agility. Large numbers of adult dragonflies were killed over the entire flight season by motor vehicle collisions, exhibiting the need for assessing the long-term impact of roadway mortality on dragonfly population dynamics.},

We characterized the role of changing habitat quality and new disturbance features on patterns of grizzly bear seasonal home-range fidelity and drift by comparing consecutive-year seasonal home ranges. We relied on the geographic technique " spatial\textendash temporal analysis of moving polygons " (STAMP) to examine changes in habitat quality and new development between zones of home-range fidelity, expansion, and contraction. Areas considered to be high-quality habitat were selected at a greater frequency than available and retained in zones of home-range fidelity, but also vacated during home-range contraction. Areas of decreasing habitat quality were equally present in zones of contraction, expansion, and stability. The proportion of new forest harvest areas and roads developed within the past year did not differ between zones of home-range change, but the proportion of new well sites was higher in contraction zones than in stability zones. Our results showed that while considerable drift occurs, changes in habitat quality and recent anthro-pogenic disturbances cannot account for annual variation in home ranges, suggesting other important factors influencing behaviour and movement.

  abstract = {Palaeontologists increasingly use large datasets of observations collected from museum specimens to address broad-scale questions about evolution and ecology on geological timescales. One such question is whether information from fossil organisms can be used as a robust proxy for atmospheric carbon dioxide through time. Here, we present the citizen science branch of `Fossil Atmospheres', a project designed to refine stomatal index of Ginkgo leaves as a palaeo-CO2 proxy by involving citizen scientists in data col- lection through the Zooniverse website. Citizen science helped to overcome a barrier presented by the time taken to count cells in Ginkgo samples; however, a new set of challenges arose as a result. A beta-testing phase with Zooniverse volunteers provided an opportunity to improve instructions to ensure high fidelity data. Exploration of citizen scientists' estimates shows that volunteer counts of stomata are accurate with respect to counts made by the project's lead scientist. However, counts of epidermal cells have a wide range, and mean values tend to underestimate expert counts. We demonstrate a variety of approaches to reducing the inaccuracy in the calculated stomatal index that this variation causes. Zooniverse serves as an ideal tool for collection of palaeontological data where the distribution of fossils would be impossible, but where specimens can be easily imaged. Such an approach facilitates the collection of a large palaeontological dataset, as well as providing an opportunity for citizens to engage with climate research.

  abstract = {Recent studies have established the ecological and evolutionary importance of animal personalities. Individual differences in movement and space-use, fundamental to many personality traits (e.g. activity, boldness and exploratory behaviour) have been documented across many species and contexts, for instance personality-dependent dispersal syndromes. Yet, insights from the concurrently developing movement ecology paradigm are rarely considered and recent evidence for other personality-dependent movements and space-use lack a general unifying framework. We propose a conceptual framework for personality-dependent spatial ecology. We link expectations derived from the movement ecology paradigm with behavioural reaction-norms to offer specific predictions on the interactions between environmental factors, such as resource distribution or landscape structure, and intrinsic behavioural variation. We consider how environmental hetero-geneity and individual consistency in movements that carry-over across spatial scales can lead to personality-dependent: (1) foraging search performance; (2) habitat preference; (3) home range utilization patterns; (4) social network structure and (5) emergence of assortative population structure with spatial clusters of personalities. We support our conceptual model with spatially explicit simulations of behavioural variation in space-use, demonstrating the emergence of complex population level patterns from differences in simple individual-level behaviours. Consideration of consistent individual variation in space-use will facilitate mechanistic understanding of processes that drive social, spatial, ecological and evolutionary dynamics in heterogeneous environments.},

  abstract = {Summary. We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the `hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of what we have learned about the ecological roles of forest structure in the Pacific Northwest and how forest structure changes as a result of disturbance and succession. Forests are structurally diverse, but many structures derive from the same processes of disturbance and growth. Consequently. measurements on a few structural attributes can be used to estimate many other structural conditions. Particularly important components of forest structure include live-tree sizes. vertical foliage distributions, horizontal variation in canopy density. and coarse woody debris. Knowledge of the ecological roles of these structures has increased in recent years and we now have a general understanding of how these structures change during succession.

Although urbanization poses a substantial threat to biodiversity, cities also support many species, some of which have larger populations, faster growth rates, and higher productivity in cities than outside of them. Despite this fact, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the potentially beneficial links between cities and their surroundings. We identify five pathways by which cities can benefit regional ecosystems by releasing species from threats in the larger landscape, increasing regional habitat heterogeneity and genetic diversity, acting as migratory stopovers, preadapting species to climate change, and enhancing public engagement and environmental stewardship. Increasing recognition of these pathways could help cities identify effective strategies for supporting regional biodiversity conservation and could provide a science-based platform for incorporating biodiversity alongside other urban greening goals.},

Over the years, there has been a movement from data transformation toward model reformation\textemdash the use of non- normal error structures within the frame- work of the generalized linear model (GLM). The principal advantage of model refor- mation is that parameters are estimated on the original, rather than the transformed scale. However, data transformation has been shown to give better control over type I error, for simulated data with known error structures. We conducted a literature review of statistical textbooks directed toward biologists and of journal articles pub- lished in the primary literature to determine temporal trends in both the text recom- mendations and the practice in the refereed literature over the past 35 years. In this review, a trend of increasing use of reformation in the primary literature was evident, moving from no use of reformation before 1996 to {$>$}50\% of the articles reviewed applying GLM after 2006. However, no such trend was observed in the recommenda- tions in statistical textbooks. We then undertook 12 analyses based on published datasets in which we compared the type I error estimates, residual plot diagnostics, and coefficients yielded by analyses using square root transformations, log transfor- mations, and the GLM. All analyses yielded acceptable residual versus fit plots and had similar p- values within each analysis, but as expected, the coefficient estimates dif- fered substantially. Furthermore, no consensus could be found in the literature regard- ing a procedure to back- transform the coefficient estimates obtained from linear models performed on transformed datasets. This lack of consistency among coeffi- cient estimates constitutes a major argument for model reformation over data trans- formation in biology.},

We sought to determine if estuarine emergent marsh restoration projects (Galveston Bay, Texas) that had successfully achieved permit-mandated plant coverage were comparable to reference sites at an ecosystem level. We used a Rapid Assessment Method developed specifically for this habitat (Galv-RAM) to compare restored (ages 5\textendash 15 y) and reference marshes. Thirteen biotic and abiotic characteristics were used to calculate an ecosystem index score, whereby a pristine habitat would score 100\%. The average Galv-RAM ecosystem index score for reference marshes (81\%) was typical for urbanized estuaries. Restored marshes scored 75\%, indicating that they were relatively well developed, although there was substantial variability in ecosystem index scores among sites. Discriminant function analysis revealed that reference sites had more benthic epifauna (periwinkles, fiddler crabs); epifauna were virtually absent from restored sites. Overall, Galv-RAM scores did not vary with restored marsh age, but some individual features changed over time: older restored sites tended to have higher plant diversity and belowground plant biomass than younger restored sites. The ultimate goal of coastal wetland restoration is to improve the integrity of the regional wetland landscape by augmenting many different ecosystem functions. Therefore, although not all measured variables scored optimally in all restored sites, each of the sites had relatively high ecological value and contributed to the integrity of a larger scale matrix of wetland habitat.},

We suggest that interconnected networks of remote cameras will soon monitor biodiversity at a global scale, help answer pressing ecological questions, and guide conservation policy. This global network will require greater collaboration among remote- camera studies and citizen scientists, including standardized metadata, shared protocols, and security measures to protect records about sensitive species. With modest investment in infrastructure, and continued innovation, synthesis, and collaboration, we envision a global network of remote cameras that not only provides real- time biodiversity data but also serves to connect people with nature.},

These changes have, in turn, altered the composition of leaf litter in woodland ponds with consequences for the organisms they harbour, such as amphibian larvae. 2. We used mesocosms to assess how 10 species of allochthonous litter, which differ in their regional abundance and chemical composition, affect ephemeral ponds. We were particularly interested in effects on larval amphibian fitness, including metamorphic mass, larval period and survival. 3. Litter had strong effects on the fitness of larval wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), water chemistry, and phytoplankton and periphyton biomass in the mesocosms. Litter from green ash (Fraxinus penn-sylvanica), a tree species in decline, enabled frog larvae to grow larger, develop faster and survive better than larvae from other litter treatments. Interestingly, three invasive wetland plant species pro-duced heavy metamorphs, with shorter larval periods and higher survival relative to native wetland plants. Litter from red maple (Acer rubrum, now among the most abundant native trees in the eastern United States), cattail (Typha latifolia) and sedge (Carex stricta) produced metamorphs that were small and survived poorly. 4. Mass at metamorphosis was best explained by litter quality (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content) and primary producer biomass, while survival and larval period were best explained by a combination of litter quality, primary producer biomass and water chemistry (polyphenolics and pH). Additionally, litter quality and primary producer biomass explained differences in the elemental composition of metamorphs. Lastly, our data suggest that litter nitrogen may be a limiting resource that affects the export of metamorphic frog biomass from ephemeral ponds. 5. Overall, our results indicate that anthropogenic changes in plant communities lead to changes in the quality of allochthonous litter input and strongly affect amphibian fitness.},

  abstract = {Least-cost models are widely used to study the functional connectivity of habitat within a varied landscape matrix. A critical step in the process is identifying resistance values for each land cover based upon the facilitating or impeding impact on species movement. Ideally resistance values would be parameterised with empirical data, but due to a shortage of such information, expert-opinion is often used. However, the use of expert-opinion is seen as subjective, human-centric and unreliable. This study derived resistance values from grey squirrel habitat suitability models (HSM) in order to compare the utility and validity of this approach with more traditional, expert-led methods. Models were built and tested with MaxEnt, using squirrel presence records and a categorical land cover map for Cumbria, UK. Predictions on the likelihood of squirrel occurrence within each land cover type were inverted, providing resistance values which were used to parameterise a leastcost model. The resulting habitat networks were measured and compared to those derived from a least-cost model built with previously collated information from experts. The expert-derived and HSM-inferred least-cost networks differ in precision. The HSM-informed networks were smaller and more fragmented because of the higher resistance values attributed to most habitats. These results are discussed in relation to the applicability of both approaches for conservation and management objectives, providing guidance to researchers and practitioners attempting to apply and interpret a leastcost approach to mapping ecological networks.},

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) have complex reactions to forest disturbances due to their use of forest clearings for foraging, their large home ranges, and the continued human expansion into undisturbed grizzly bear habitat. The goal of this paper is to quantify how grizzly bears interact with forest distur-bances over time in west-central Alberta in order to inform habitat management decisions. This is accomplished using a four-decade remotely sensed disturbance history and detailed grizzly bear movement and habitat use information. Global positioning systems (GPS) collars were used to collect telemetry data for 22 adult grizzly bears (8 females, 14 males) from 2005 to 2009 in the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rockies. The resultant telemetry data were partitioned based on known biological variation in habitat selection into sex and seasonal groups. Density of grizzly bear telemetry locations was calculated for each forest disturbance and compared to expected density via a randomization condi-tioned on observed trends in overall habitat use. The comparison of observed and expected density of grizzly bear telemetry locations allowed disturbances to be labelled as selected or avoided. Each disturbance was attributed with characteristics (area, elevation, average tasselled cap transformation (TCT) greenness, and distance to nearest populated place), which were compared between selected and avoided disturbances using a ManneWhitney U-test. Male bears selected for 30e40-year-old disturbances more frequently than younger disturbances; females demonstrated equal selection of all ages of disturbances except those less than 10 years old. Females selected for disturbances more in the summer and fall than the spring. Disturbances selected by female bears were larger, with lower TCT greenness, and a consistent elevation (1250e1300 m) across seasons and disturbance age. Male bears showed lower selection of disturbances in the fall than in other seasons, and lower selection than females in the summer and fall. Compared to females, disturbances selected by males were larger, and more likely to show seasonal variation in greenness and elevation. Both sexes selected for larger disturbances of all ages, although disturbance size has generally decreased through time. Limiting human access to disturbances with characteristics attractive to grizzly bears will reduce grizzly bear and human interactions, and reduce mortality.},

  abstract = {Understanding a species' behavioral response to rapid environmental change is an ongoing challenge in modern conservation. Anthropogenic landscape modification, or "human footprint," is well documented as a central cause of large mammal decline and range contractions where the proximal mechanisms of decline are often contentious. Direct mortality is an obvious cause; alternatively, human-modified landscapes perceived as unsuitable by some species may contribute to shifts in space use through preferential habitat selection. A useful approach to tease these effects apart is to determine whether behaviors potentially associated with risk vary with human footprint. We hypothesized wolverine (Gulo gulo) behaviors vary with different degrees of human footprint. We quantified metrics of behavior, which we assumed to indicate risk perception, from photographic images from a large existing camera-trapping dataset collected to understand wolverine distribution in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. We systematically deployed 164 camera sites across three study areas covering approximately 24,000~km(2), sampled monthly between December and April (2007-2013). Wolverine behavior varied markedly across the study areas. Variation in behavior decreased with increasing human footprint. Increasing human footprint may constrain potential variation in behavior, through either restricting behavioral plasticity or individual variation in areas of high human impact. We hypothesize that behavioral constraints may indicate an increase in perceived risk in human-modified landscapes. Although survival is obviously a key contributor to species population decline and range loss, behavior may also make a significant contribution.},

Thirty-two richness-based third-order polynomial regression models (R{$>$}0.99, P{$<$}0.001, n=28\textendash 71) were constructed to characterize these relationships. A composite diagram showed richness varied curvilinearly, with steepness increasing and the spacing between curves decreasing with greater evenness and H{${'}$}. Maximum H{${'}$} values for each richness curve were equal to logeS (when E=1), whereas minima were approximated by evenness values of {$\sim$}1/S (when H{${'}$}=0). It was concluded from multiple and polynomial regression analyses that: (i) evenness contributed more than richness (E:S {$\geq$}3:1) to determining H{${'}$}, based on standardized partial beta-coefficients; (ii) the differential in E:S ratios increased with greater richness; (iii) the patterns of H{${'}$} sample variation between maximum unevenness and perfect evenness was convexo-concave shaped; and (iv) richness as an explanatory variable of H{${'}$} was likely an artifact of evenness (0\textendash 1 scale) being rescaled according to individual H{${'}$} maxima. H{${'}$} was redefined as a logarithm-weighted measure of evenness at a given level of richness, which means H{${'}$} is either an imperfect index of diversity or a biased measure of evenness. It was also found that the fundamental components of the Shannon\textendash Wiener index measure dominance concentration rather than evenness, with the reversal in emphasis due to multiplication of the H{${'}$} equation by -1. H{${'}$}-derived effective species numbers (exp H{${'}$}, D) increasingly deviated from those of the diversity model D=S\texttimes E in response to increasing richness (up to 69\% for 35 species), particularly when evenness was between 0.15 and 0.40. Of two cross-validated H{${'}$} prediction methods (P{$<$}0.001, n=325), the collective use of individual richness-based polynomial regression equations (r=0.954) was better than a single multiple regression model that incorporated a broad spectrum of richness levels (r=0.882). A simple graphic model was constructed to illustrate patterns of evenness variation as a function of changing richness and H{${'}$} values. Based on the identified biases, particularly E:S ratios, it was recommended that use of H{${'}$} be discontinued as a basis for assessing diversity in ecological research or, at the very least, accompanied by independent analyzes of richness and evenness.},

Among the many advancements this revolution has brought is an ability to record behavioral responses of nocturnal, free-ranging species. Here, we combine captive validations of acceleration signatures with acoustic recordings from free-ranging individuals to classify behavior at two resolutions. Combining these classifications with {$\sim$}2 month-long recordings, we describe winter time budgets, and responses of free-ranging snowshoe hares to changing moonlight. We successfully classified snowshoe hare behavior into four categories (not moving, foraging, hopping, and sprinting) using low frequency accelerometry, with an overall model accuracy of 88\%, and acoustic recordings to three categories (silence, hopping, and chewing) with an accuracy of 94\%. Broad-scale accelerometer-classified categories were composed of multiple fine-scale behavioral states with the composition varying between individuals and across the day. Time budgets revealed that hares spent {$\sim$}50\% of their time foraging and {$\sim$}50\% not moving, with most foraging and feeding occurring at night. We found that hares adjusted timing of activity in response to moon phase, with a 6\% reduction in foraging and 30\% reduction in traveling during the night when the moon was full. Hares compensated for this lost foraging time by extending foraging into the morning hours of the following day. Using two biologging technologies to identify behavior, we demonstrate the possibility of combining multiple devices when documenting behavior of cryptic species.},

  abstract = {Range boundaries are a manifestation of species' tolerances to environmental factors, including climate and human disturbance. As such, studying populations persisting along range boundaries can provide important insights into species' sensitivity to environmental change. Because multiple environmental influences may contribute to a range limit, studies focusing on range boundaries can guide management and conservation of these critical populations. To this end, we quantified the environmental factors associated with snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) occurrence at their southern range limit in Wisconsin. We surveyed 199 locations across a regional southern range boundary of snowshoe hares and analyzed the data within an occupancy modeling framework to test the hypothesis that this range boundary results from an interaction between winter climate and land cover. We found that dense vegetation structure and increasing forest and snow cover duration had positive effects on snowshoe hare occupancy along their southern range boundary, supporting our prediction that a suite of abiotic factors is associated with the southerly distribution of this winter-adapted mammal. These effects were additive and we found limited support for climate\textendash land cover interactions, forest composition, winter snow depth, or predator occurrence. Spatial predictions of occupancy using only forest and snow cover variables denote a sharp range boundary, further illustrating the importance of these variables in shaping this species distribution. Our results highlight an important vulnerability of snowshoe hares to future climate change, and options for mediating this vulnerability through the maintenance of early successional habitat and forested landscapes along their southern range boundary. \'O 2016 The Wildlife Society.},

The main source of MeHg exposure is seafood consumption, including many marine species harvested from the global oceans. Fish, birds and other wildlife are also susceptible to the impacts of MeHg and already exceed toxicological thresholds in vulnerable regions like the Arctic. Most future emissions scenarios project a growth or stabilization of anthropogenic mercury releases relative to present-day levels. At these emissions levels, inputs of mercury to ecosystems are expected to increase substantially in the future, in part due to growth in the legacy reservoirs of mercury in oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems. Seawater mercury concentration trajectories in areas such as the North Pacific Ocean that supply large quantities of marine fish to the global seafood market are projected to increase by more than 50\% by 2050. Fish mercury levels and subsequent human and biological exposures are likely to also increase because production of MeHg in ocean ecosystems is driven by the supply of available inorganic mercury, among other factors. Analyses that only consider changes in primary anthropogenic emissions are likely to underestimate the severity of future deposition and concentration increases associated with growth in mercury reservoirs in the land and ocean. We therefore recommend that future policy analyses consider the fully coupled interactions among short and long-lived reservoirs of mercury in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial ecosystems. Aggressive anthropogenic emission reductions are needed to reduce MeHg exposures and associated health impacts on humans and wildlife and protect the integrity of one of the last wild-food sources globally. In the near-term, public health advice on safe fish consumption choices such as smaller species, younger fish, and harvests from relatively unpolluted ecosystems is needed to minimize exposure risks.},

  abstract = {Regulating ecosystem services (ES) fundamentally underpin biosphere integrity, human safety, and the provision of most other ES. However, the pathways by which regulating ES generate benefits for people are complex and vary spatially and temporally. Emerging ES decision-making frameworks underemphasize regulating services because they focus on ES that have more obvious links to human wellbeing (e.g., in close proximity to beneficiaries with very short time lags). Lack of attention towards regulating ES can lead to unintended management trade-offs that create risk for human wellbeing and can cause immediate and delayed impacts on cultural and provisioning ES. Therefore, a remaining challenge for ES frameworks is to address the full ensemble of processes and feedbacks whereby ecosystems contribute to human wellbeing over time, including through regulating services. We address this challenge by (i) reviewing the complexities associated with regulating ES components\textemdash capacity, ecological pressures, and demand, (ii) exploring the spatial and temporal variability that influence regulating ES components, including the flow of service benefits, and (iii) illustrating the interdependency of regulating ES components through examples of ES that are linked hydrologically. We conclude that ES capacity, pressure, demand and the flow of benefits are distinct, but intricately linked components that influence how regulating ES provide benefits and improve human wellbeing. We pose that ES assessment frameworks could be improved by including indicators of regulating ES that differentiate between the capacity to provide a regulating ES, the demand for the same, and the actual service that is conveyed, the latter of which is influenced by underlying capacity and ecological pressure. These indicators should also be spatially and temporally explicit to fully incorporate the dynamic influence of temporal variability, spatial scale, and landscape configuration on regulating ES and the benefits they yield.},

  abstract = {Plant nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content regulate productivity and carbon (C) sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems. Estimates of the allocation of N and P content in plant tissues and the relationship between nutrient content and photosynthetic capacity are critical to predicting future ecosystem C sequestration under global change. In this study, by investigating the nutrient concentrations of plant leaves, stems, and roots across China's terrestrial biomes, we document large-scale patterns of community-level concentrations of C, N, and P. We also examine the possible correlation between nutrient content and plant production as indicated by vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP). The nationally averaged community concentrations of C, N, and P were 436.8, 14.14, and 1.11 mg{$\cdot$}g -1 for leaves; 448.3, 3.04 and 0.31 mg{$\cdot$}g -1 for stems; and 418.2, 4.85, and 0.47 mg{$\cdot$}g -1 for roots, respectively. The nationally averaged leaf N and P productivity was 249.5 g C GPP{$\cdot$}g-1 N{$\cdot$}y -1 and 3,157.9 g C GPP{$\cdot$}g-1 P{$\cdot$}y -1 , respectively. The N and P concentrations in stems and roots were generally more sensitive to the abiotic environment than those in leaves. There were strong power-law relationships between N (or P) content in different tissues for all biomes, which were closely coupled with vegetation GPP. These findings not only provide key parameters to develop empirical models to scale the responses of plants to global change from a single tissue to the whole community but also offer large-scale evidence of biome-dependent regulation of C sequestration by nutrients. allocation | leaf nitrogen productivity | leaf phosphorus productivity | nutrient concentrations | plant stoichiometry P lant growth is the dominant process that controls carbon (C) input to terrestrial ecosystems. It requires at least 16 elements in differing proportions (1). These elements are strongly coupled with C-sequestration processes, such as plant primary production and respiration (1, 2). C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) are the most important limiting nutrients for C se-questration in ecosystems (3). C constitutes the basic structure of plants and accounts for ca. 50\% of plant biomass; N is an essential component of enzymes; and P is an essential element of nucleic acids and membrane lipids (2). The concentrations of N ([N]) and P ([P]) in plant tissues are also critical in controlling other ecological processes, such as grazing, parasitism, and decomposition (4). The productivity and C sequestration of ecosystems depend largely on the availability of N and P to plants (3, 5, 6), especially under future conditions of rising atmospheric CO 2 , N and P deposition, and global climate change (5-7). Estimates of N and P content, their allocations in different plant tissues, and the relationships between the metabolically active N and P content and photosynthetic capacity are often used to predict the future C sequestration of ecosystems under global change (7, 8). Large-scale patterns of plant stoichiometry have been explored at the species and site level, mostly based on meta-analyses of surveys in the literature (8-11). These studies report general patterns in which [N] and [P] increase with latitude and decrease with temperature and precipitation (11-14). The patterns of species-level stoichiometry reflect the replacement of species along environmental gradients (9, 11) but not the variations in nutrient concentrations within species (14, 15). Site-level studies use the average nutrient concentrations of different species found within a site (13). However, these previous studies cannot reflect patterns and processes at the community level, which depend on the abundance (or biomass) of different species within a community (9). Within a site, leaf nutrient concentrations could vary by an order of magnitude between species (16). When estimating ecosystem-level features, the over-or underrepresentation of any species may cause errors. Therefore, to better understand Significance Estimates of nutrient allocation in different plant tissues and the relationships between the nutrient contents and photosynthetic capacity are critical to predicting ecosystem carbon sequestration under global change. Here, we provide an assessment of large-scale patterns of community-level nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in different plant tissues and then examine how nutrient allocations are coupled with plant productivity. The results show that nutrient concentrations in leaves are less responsive to abiotic environments than those in woody stems and roots (stable leaf nutrient concentration hypothesis); the relationships between vegetation primary productivity and leaf nutrient contents are stronger when less nutrients are allocated to the woody tissues (productivity-nutrient allocation hypothesis) and are stronger in deciduous than in evergreen vegetation (productivity-leaf lifespan hypothesis).},

Until relatively recently, the simple eyes of both larvae and adults have been termed "ocelli" (ocellus), although it has been recognized that these are two different groups that are innervated from different parts of the brain. One group of simple eyes, found in adult insects and larvae of nonholometabolans, is termed "dorsal ocelli" or simply "ocelli." These structures are innervated dorsally from the protocerebrum between the optic lobes. The second group of simple eyes, formerly termed "lateral ocelli" but now termed "stemmata" (singular stemma), is found in the larvae of Holometabola. Stemmata are innervated laterally from the optic lobes, and typically there is a group on each side of the head. The number of stemmata is variable, ranging from zero to seven, and the number and arrangement can be diagnostic. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Habitat loss and fragmentation associated with urbanisation are major threats to both partners. Yet how and why bee and floral richness and diversity co-vary within the urban landscape remain unclear. Here, we sampled bees and flowering plants in urban green spaces to investigate how bee and flowering plant species richness, their phylogenetic diversity and pollination-relevant functional trait diversity influence each other in response to urban fragmentation. As expected, bee abundance and richness were positively related to flowering plant richness, with bee body size (but not bee richness and diversity) increasing with nectar-holder depth of flowering plants. Causal modelling indicated that bottom-up effects dictated patterns of bee-flower relationships, with urban fragmentation diminishing flowering plants richness and thereby indirectly reducing bee species richness and abundance. The close relationship between bees and flowering plants highlights the risks of their parallel declines in response to land-use change within the urban landscape.},

The autocorrelation of environmental heterogeneity is hypothesized to explain this scale dependence because it influences how quickly biodiversity accumulates over space or time. However, this link has yet to be demonstrated in a formal model. Here we use a LotkaVolterra competition model to simulate community dynamics when environmental conditions vary across either space or time. Species differ in their optimal environmental conditions, which results in turnover in community composition. We vary biodiversity by modelling communities with different sized regional species pools and ask how the amount of biomass per unit area depends on the number of species present, and the spatial or temporal scale at which it is measured. We find that more biodiversity is required to maintain functioning at larger temporal and spatial scales. The number of species required increases quickly when environmental autocorrelation is low, and slowly when autocorrelation is high. Both spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity led to scale dependence in BEF, but autocorrelation had larger impacts when environmental change was temporal. These findings show how the biodiversity required to maintain functioning is expected to increase over space and time.},

We outline the environmental conditions of these urban ponds to identify which local and landscape scale environmental variables determine the biodiversity and conservation value of the macroinvertebrate assemblages in the ponds. Cluster analysis identified four groups of ponds with contrasting macroinvertebrate assemblages reflecting differences in macrophyte cover, nutrient status, riparian shading, the nature of the pond edge, surrounding land-use and the availability of other wetland habitats. Pond conservation status varied markedly across the sites. The richest macroin-vertebrate assemblages with high conservation value were found in ponds with complex macrophyte stands and floating vegetation with low nutrient concentrations and little surrounding urban land.

  abstract = {Maintaining forest biodiversity requires an understanding of how forest-dependent species respond to a variety of forestry activities. This is particularly true for mammals, which often act as keystone species or focal species for conservation efforts in forest ecosystems. Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) serve as an important herbivore and prey resource throughout their range in the boreal forest. We examined the response of hares to partial and clearcut harvest, site preparation activities (post-harvest burning or chemical/mechanical preparation for regrowth), and precommercial thinning, using pellet plots on 359 forest stands across an expansive landscape in northern Idaho over a 5-year period. Hares initially responded negatively to harvest, with clearcut harvest having a greater negative impact than partial harvest , and this response was exacerbated by site preparation activities. Mid-successional stands (15-40 years old) that had been clear cut with site preparation treatments applied or partially harvested with no site preparations applied had greater snowshoe hare pellet counts than mature or recently harvested stands. Pre-commercial thinning had no detectable effect on hares in this landscape. Our findings suggest an interaction between site preparation and type of harvest (clear-cut vs. partial), which suggests that both the initial negative impacts and subsequent positive response to site preparation as stands age are attenuated somewhat in partially harvested vs. clear-cut stands. Our results likely relate to the influence of management activities on vegetative cover, which is strongly related to hare abundance in a variety of systems. They suggest that silvicultural activities such as site preparation could be damaging to hare populations when applied widely across landscapes, particularly when young age classes predominate. However, because the effects of harvest and site preparation are largely transitory, use of these techniques may not substantially depress hare populations if enough stands can be maintained in the 15-40 year age class.},

Here we investigate if these dive patterns can be explained by dynamic optimal foraging theory, where the tuna maximizes its energy harvest rate. We assume that foraging efficiency increases with body temperature, so that the vertical migrations are thermoregulatory. The tuna's state is characterized by its mean body temperature and depth, and we solve the optimization problem numerically using dynamic programming. With little calibration of model parameters, our results are consistent with observed data on vertical movement: we find that small tuna should display constant-depth strategies while large tuna should display vertical migrations. The analysis supports the hypothesis that the tuna behaves such as to maximize its energy gains. The model therefore provides insight into the processes underlying observed behavioral patterns and allows generating predictions of foraging behavior in unobserved environments.},

However, salamander responses to timber harvest vary considerably from one study to the next \textendash{} some studies have shown limited or no effects whereas others have found harvest-related declines of up to 95\%. To estimate overall effect sizes of timber harvest on salamander populations and to examine factors that contribute to var-iation in salamander responses to harvest, we carried out a meta-analysis of published studies of the effects of timber harvesting on terrestrial salamander abundance. Based on 108 salamander species/treat-ment combinations from 24 studies, we found mean harvest-related declines ranged from 29\% (95\% CI = \`A2\% to 51\%) for long-term responses to partial canopy removal to 62\% (95\% CI = 29\% to 80\%) for short-term responses to clearcutting. Multivariate mixed models suggested that clearcutting had a mod-estly greater impact on salamander populations than partial harvest and that decreases following harvest were more pronounced at sites with warmer summer high temperatures. In addition, active sampling of salamanders (e.g., surface counts) led to greater apparent effects of timber harvest than passive sampling (e.g., cover boards or pitfall traps), suggesting that sampling methodology influenced the perceived effects of harvest. In the studies evaluated, salamander numbers almost always declined following timber removal, but salamanders were never extirpated and populations typically increased as forests regenerated.},

All wetlands had a history of artificial drainage and seven were subjected to small-scale flooding during the complete study period (two sites) or the two last years (five sites). We used an approach in which specific runoff data determined at hydrological stations situated at a distance from the studied sites were used in the calculation of water and element budgets. All wetlands except one were significant sinks for Hg-inorg. Seven wetlands were consistent sources of MeHg and one (an Alnus glutinosa swamp) was a significant sink. The pattern of MeHg yields was in good agreement with previously determined methylation and demethylation rates in the wetland soils of this study, with a maximum MeHg yield obtained in wetlands with an intermediate soil acidity (pH similar to 5.0) and C/N ratio (similar to 20). We hypothesize that an increased nutrient status from poor to intermediate conditions promotes methylation over demethylation, whereas a further increase in nutrient status and trophy to meso- and eutrophic conditions promotes demethylation over methylation. Small-scale flooding showed no or moderate changes in MeHg yield, maintaining differences among wetlands related to nutrient status.},

Stream chloride concentrations were directly correlated with development in the watersheds and were inversely related to streamflow. Exceedances of the EPA water quality standard for chloride were detected in the four watersheds with the most development. The number of exceedances during a year was linearly related to the annual average concentration of chloride. Exceedances of the water quality standard were not predicted for streams with annual average concentrations less than 102 mg L -1 . Chloride was imported into three of the watersheds at rates ranging from 45 to 98 Mg Cl km -2 yr -1 . Ninety-one percent of the chloride imported was road salt for deicing roadways and parking lots. A simple, mass balance equation was shown to predict annual average chloride concentrations from streamflow and chloride import rates to the watershed. This equation, combined with the apparent threshold for exceedances of the water quality standard, can be used for screening-level TMDLs for road salt in impaired watersheds.},

Urban streams are distinguished from forested or agricultural streams, in particular, by their more variable and unpredictable hydrologic pattern. The resulting high variability in nutrient loading is likely to alter the elemental composition of primary producers and, ultimately, to change the elemental composition of other foodweb components. Ecological stoichiometry is a useful framework for improving our understanding of the mass balance of multiple key elements in ecosystems. To this end, the C:N:P of key foodweb components were measured in Oxley Creek, an urban catchment in southeastern Queensland, Australia. Ten stream reaches were sampled to explore the spatial variation of C:N:P of abundant taxonomic groups across the catchment. Four of these sites were sampled weekly (for 8 wk) to examine temporal variation in elemental composition. Our results suggested that spatial and temporal variation in elemental composition of primary producers and some animal taxa were highly dependent on local (i.e., site) conditions. This local dependence makes determination of catchment-wide drivers of stoichiometric variability difficult, but our results do suggest that site-based influences in urban streams can generate substantial variability in the C:N:P content of in-stream biota. In the context of other studies that have been undertaken principally in forested streams, this application of ecological stoichiometry promises to further our understanding of the effects of urbanization on stream food webs and the stability of elemental flow. \textcopyright{} 2011 The North American Benthological Society.},

We extracted the raw data from published tables and graphs and subjected these data to a standardized analysis, using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and generalized linear-model (GLIM) regression to test for significant positive, negative, or curvilinear relationships between productivity and species diversity. If the rela- tionship was curvilinear, we tested whether the maximum (or minimum) of the curve occurred within the range of productivity values observed (i.e., was there evidence of a hump?). A meta-analysis conducted on the distribution of standardized quadratic regression co- efficients showed that the average quadratic coefficient was negative (i.e., the average species richnessproductivity relationship was curvilinear and decelerating), and that the distribution of standardized quadratic regression coefficients was significantly heterogeneous (i.e., the studies did not sample the same underlying species richnessproductivity relationship). Looking more closely at the patterns of productivitydiversity relationships, we found that, for vascular plants at geographical scales smaller than continents, hump-shaped re- lationships occurred most frequently (4145\% of all studies). A positive relationship be- tween productivity and species richness was the next most common pattern, and positive and hump-shaped relationships co-dominated at the continental scale. For animals, positive, negative, and hump-shaped patterns were common at most geographical scales, and no one pattern predominated. For both plants and animals, hump-shaped curves were relatively more common in studies that crossed community boundaries compared to studies conducted within a community type, and plant studies that crossed community types tended to span a greater range of productivity compared to studies within community types. Sample size and plot size did not affect the probability of finding a particular productivitydiversity relationship (e.g., positive, hump-shaped, etc.). However, hump-shaped curves were es- pecially common (65\%) in studies of plant diversity that used plant biomass as a measure of productivity, and in studies conducted in aquatic systems.},

In this article, we explore the range of theoretical consequences that result from relaxing this assumption. We show, with a variety of modeling techniques, that matrix quality can be extremely important in determining metapopulation dynamics. A higher-quality matrix generally buffers against extinction. However, in some situations, an increase in matrix quality can generate chaotic subpopulation dynamics, where stability had been the rule in a lower-quality matrix. Furthermore, subpopulations acting as source populations in a low-quality matrix may develop metapopulation dynamics as the quality of the matrix increases. By forcing metapopulation dynamics on a formerly heterogeneous (but stable within subpopulations) population, the probability of simultaneous extinction of all subpopulations actually increases. Thus, it cannot be automatically assumed that increasing matrix quality will lower the probability of global extinction of a population.},

  abstract = {\textbackslash nUnderstanding factors influencing changes in population trajectory is important for effective wildlife management, particularly for populations of conservation concern. Annual population growth of the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, USA has slowed from 4.2\textendash 7.6\% during 1983\textendash 2001 to 0.3\textendash 2.2\% during 2002\textendash 2011. Substantial changes in availability of a key food source and bear population density have occurred. Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), the seeds of which are a valuable but variable fall food for grizzly bears, has experienced substantial mortality primarily due to a mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak that started in the early 2000s. Positive growth rates of grizzly bears have resulted in populations reaching high densities in some areas and have contributed to continued range expansion. We tested research hypotheses to examine if changes in vital rates detected during the past decade were more associated with whitebark pine decline or, alternatively, increasing grizzly bear density. We focused our assessment on known-fate data to estimate survival of cubs-of-the-year (cubs), yearlings, and independent bears ({$\geq$}2 yrs), and reproductive transition of females from having no offspring to having cubs. We used spatially and temporally explicit indices for grizzly bear density and whitebark pine mortality as individual covariates. Models indicated moderate support for an increase in survival of independent male bears over 1983\textendash 2012, whereas independent female survival did not change. Cub survival, yearling survival, and reproductive transition from no offspring to cubs all changed during the 30-year study period, with lower rates evident during the last 10\textendash 15 years. Cub survival and reproductive transition were negatively associated with an index of grizzly bear density, indicating greater declines where bear densities were higher. Our analyses did not support a similar relationship for the index of whitebark pine mortality. The results of our study support the interpretation that slowing of population growth during the last decade was associated more with increasing grizzly bear density than the decline in whitebark pine. Grizzly bear density and its potential effect on vital rates and population trajectory warrant consideration for management of the grizzly bear population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

Some in-situ experiments are discussed as well. When well designed, such natural devices have the potential to abate surface transport noise, possibly by complementing and sometimes improving common (non-natural) noise reducing devices or measures.

  abstract = {The surface reflectance, i.e., satellite derived top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance corrected for the temporally, spatially and spectrally varying scattering and absorbing effects of atmospheric gases and aerosols, is needed to monitor the land surface reliably. For this reason, the surface reflectance, and not TOA reflectance, is used to generate the greater majority of global land products, for example, from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors. Even if atmospheric effects are minimized by sensor design, atmospheric effects are still challenging to correct. In particular, the strong impact of aerosols in the visible and near infrared spectral range can be difficult to correct, because they can be highly discrete in space and time (e.g., smoke plumes) and because of the complex scattering and absorbing properties of aerosols that vary spectrally and with aerosol size, shape, chemistry and density. This paper presents the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) atmospheric correction algorithm that has been developed using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum Vectorial (6SV) model, refined to take advantage of the narrow OLI spectral bands (compared to Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM +)), improved radiometric resolution and signal-to-noise. In addition, the algorithm uses the new OLI Coastal aerosol band (0.433-0.450 {$\mu$}m), which is particularly helpful for retrieving aerosol properties , as it covers shorter wavelengths than the conventional Landsat, TM and ETM+ blue bands. A cloud and cloud shadow mask has also been developed using the "cirrus" band (1.360-1.390 {$\mu$}m) available on OLI, and the thermal infrared bands from the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) instrument. The performance of the surface reflectance product from OLI is analyzed over the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites using accurate atmospheric correction (based on in situ measurements of the atmospheric properties), by comparison with the MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) adjusted surface reflectance product and by comparison of OLI derived broadband albedo from United States Surface Radiation Budget Network (US SURFRAD) measurements. The results presented clearly show an improvement of Landsat 8 surface reflectance product over the ad-hoc Landsat 5/7 LEDAPS product. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Traditional production systems have viewed animals as homogeneous `machines' whose nutritional and medicinal needs must be provided in a prescribed manner. This view arose from the lack of belief in the wisdom of the body to meet its physiological needs. Is it possible for herbivores to select diets that meet their needs for nutrients and to write their own prescriptions? Our research suggests it is. Herbivores adapt to the variability of the external environment and to their changing internal needs not only by generating homeostatic physiological responses, but also by operating in the external environment. Under this view, food selection is interpreted as the quest for substances in the external environment that provide homeostatic utility to the internal environment. Most natural landscapes are diverse mixes of plant species that are literally nutrition centres and pharmacies with vast arrays of primary (nutrient) and secondary (pharmaceutical) compounds vital in the nutrition and health of plants and herbivores. Plant-derived alkaloids, terpenes, sesquiterpene lactones and phenolics can benefit herbivores by, for instance, combating internal parasites, controlling populations of fungi and bacteria, and enhancing nutrition. Regrettably, the simplification of agricultural systems to accommodate inexpensive, rapid livestock production, coupled with a view of secondary compounds as toxins, has resulted in selecting for a biochemical balance in forages favouring primary (mainly energy) and nearly eliminating secondary compounds. There is a global need to create a more sustainable agriculture, with less dependence on external finite resources, such as fossil fuels and their environmentally detrimental derivatives. Self-medication has the potential to facilitate the design of sustainable grazing systems to improve the quality of land as well as the health and welfare of animals. Understanding foraging as the dynamic quest to achieve homeostasis will lead to implementing management programs where herbivores have access not only to diverse and nutritious foods but also to arrays of medicinal plants.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem services provide an instinctive way to understand the trade-offs associated with natural resource management. However, despite their apparent usefulness, several hurdles have prevented ecosystem services from becoming deeply embedded in environmental decision-making. Ecosystem service studies vary widely in focal services, geographic extent, and in methods for defining and measuring services. Dissent among scientists on basic terminology and approaches to evaluating ecosystem services create difficulties for those trying to incorporate ecosystem services into decisionmaking. To facilitate clearer comparison among recent studies, we provide a synthesis of common terminology and explain a rationale and framework for distinguishing among the components of ecosystem service delivery, including: an ecosystem's capacity to produce services; ecological pressures that interfere with an ecosystem's ability to provide the service; societal demand for the service; and flow of the service to people. We discuss how interpretation and measurement of these four components can differ among provisioning, regulating, and cultural services. Our flexible framework treats service capacity, ecological pressure, demand, and flow as separate but interactive entities to improve our ability to evaluate the sustainability of service provision and to help guide management decisions. We consider ecosystem service provision to be sustainable when demand is met without decreasing capacity for future provision of that service or causing undesirable declines in other services. When ecosystem service demand exceeds ecosystem capacity to provide services, society can choose to enhance natural capacity, decrease demand and/or ecological pressure, or invest in a technological substitute. Because regulating services are frequently overlooked in environmental assessments, we provide a more detailed examination of regulating services and propose a novel method for quantifying the flow of regulating services based on estimates of ecological work. We anticipate that our synthesis and framework will reduce inconsistency and facilitate coherence across analyses of ecosystem services, thereby increasing their utility in environmental decision-making.},

  abstract = {The widespread occurrence of nitrogen limitation to net primary production in terrestrial and marine ecosystems is something of a puzzle; it would seem that nitrogen fixers should have a substantial competitive advantage wherever nitrogen is limiting, and that their activity in turn should reverse limitation. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence that nitrogen limits net primary production much of the time in most terrestrial biomes and many marine ecosystems. We examine both how the biogeochemistry of the nitrogen cycle could cause limitation to develop, and how nitrogen limitation could persist as a consequence of processes that prevent or reduce nitrogen fixation. Biogeochemical mechansism that favor nitrogen limitation include:-the substantial mobility of nitrogen across ecosystem boundaries, which favors nitogen limitation in the "source" ecosystem-especially where denitrification is important in sediments and soils, or in terrestrial ecosystems where fire is frequent;-differences in the biochemistry of nitrogen as opposed to phosphorus (with detrital N mostly carbon-bonded and detrital P mostly ester-bonded), which favor the development of nitrogen limitation where decomposition is slow, and allow the development of a positive feedback from nitrogen limitation to producers, to reduced decomposition of their detritus, and on to reduced nitrogen availability; and-other more specialized, but perhaps no less important, processes. A number of mechanisms could keep nitrogen fixation from reversing nitrogen limitation. These include:-energetic constraints on the colonization or activity of nitrogen fixers;-limitation of nitrogen fixers or fixation by another nutrient (phosphorus, molybdenum, or iron)-which would then represent the ultimate factor limiting net primary production;-other physical and ecological mechanisms. The possible importance of these and other processes is discussed for a wide range of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems.},

We identify and discuss six mechanisms that could drive P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems. The best known of these is depletion-driven limitation, in which accumulated P losses during long-term soil and ecosystem development contribute to what Walker and Syers termed a "terminal steady state" of profound P depletion and limitation. The other mechanisms are soil barriers that prevent access to P; transactional limitation, in which weathering of P-containing minerals does not keep pace with the supply of other resources; low-P parent materials; P sinks; and anthropogenic changes that increase the supply of other resources (often N) relative to P. We distinguish proximate nutrient limitation (which occurs where additions of a nutrient stimulate biological processes, especially productivity) from ultimate nutrient limitation (where additions of a nutrient can transform ecosystems). Of the mechanisms that drive P limitation, we suggest that depletion, soil barriers, and low-P parent material often cause ultimate limitation because they control the ecosystem mass balance of P. Similarly, demand-independent losses and constraints to N fixation can control the ecosystem-level mass balance of N and cause it to be an ultimate limiting nutrient. \textcopyright{} 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

To manage and conserve this species effectively it is important to understand patterns of gene flow and population connectivity to identify possible barriers to disease transmission. However, little is known about the population genetic structure of little brown bats, and to date, no studies have investigated population structure across their entire range. We examined mitochondrial DNA and nuclear microsatellites in 637 little brown bats (including all currently recognized subspecific lineages) from 29 locations across North America, to assess levels of genetic variation and population differentiation across the range of the species, including areas affected by WNS and those currently unaffected. We identified considerable spatial variation in patterns of female dispersal and significant genetic variation between populations in eastern versus western portions of the range. Overall levels of nuclear genetic differentiation were low, and there is no evidence for any major barriers to gene flow across their range. However, patterns of mtDNA differentiation are highly variable, with high {$\Phi$}ST values between most sample pairs (including between all western samples, between western and eastern samples, and between some eastern samples), while low mitochondrial differentiation was observed within two groups of samples found in central and eastern regions of North America. Furthermore, the Alaskan population was highly differentiated from all others, and western populations were characterized by isolation by distance while eastern populations were not. These data raise the possibility that the current patterns of spread of WNS observed in eastern North America may not apply to the entire range and that there may be broad-scale spatial variation in the risk of WNS transmission and occurrence if the disease continues to spread west.},

The area designated as the core is often subjectively selected based on aggregations of animal locations, thus not quantitatively repeatable, or selected based on arbitrary areas from a home range estimator, thus not biologically significant. We present an explicit ecological model of space use for objectively delineating areas of intense use, or core areas, based on further refining the definition of core area as the area within which an animal spends a maximum amount of time. Core areas were delineated using a time-maximizing function derived from kernel analyses. Essentially, we plotted utilization distribution area against volume and determined the point at which the slope of the line fitted to the data is equal to 1; this point represents a threshold where the proportional home range area begins to increase at a greater rate than the probability of use and the corresponding isopleth value defines the boundary of the core area; an animal's time spent within this area is maximized relative to the periphery. We used summer locations from 60 adult female moose (Alces alces) to demonstrate our method. Moose core areas were bounded by the \textasciimacron{} x = 58\% (SD = 0.60) isopleth and comprised \textasciimacron{} x = 77\% (SD = 6.09) of animal relocations. Core areas represented \textasciimacron{} x = 27\% (SD = 1.99) of the home range (\textasciimacron{} x = 3837 ha, SD = 4336.15; 95\% utilization distribution) and were used an average of 2.16 (SD = 0.20) times more intensely than home range peripheries. Proportions of intensively used areas, as defined by isopleth values, were not related to home range size. Our technique reflects a biological understanding of a core area and provides a repeatable, quantitative method that enables statistical testing of hypotheses related to the effects of environmental factors on home range and core area size and usage. Adopting our approach will greatly improve our capacity to understand and ability to compare spatial dynamics of resource selection within home ranges of wildlife.},

Plant (15) N fractionation and foliar N : P stoichiometry of a tank epiphyte (Vriesea sanguinolenta), and its response to combined N-P fertilization, were studied under semi-natural conditions over 334 d to clarify the type of nutrient limitation. Plants collected in the field and experimental plants with limited nutrient supply showed significant plant (15) N fractionation (mean 5\textperthousand ) and plant N : P ratios of c. 13.5. Higher relative growth rates and declines in plant (15) N fractionation (0.5\textperthousand ) and in foliar N : P ratios to 8.5 in the high N-P treatment indicated that these epiphytes were P limited in situ. The critical foliar N : P ratio was 10.4, as derived from the breakpoint in the relationship between plant (15) N fractionation and foliar N : P. We interpret the widespread (15) N depletion of vascular epiphytes relative to their host trees as deriving from (15) N fractionation of epiphytes as a result of P limitation. High foliar N : P ratios ({$>$} 12) corroborate widespread P limitation (or co-limitation by N and P) of epiphytic bromeliads and, possibly, other epiphyte species.},

Methods Leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), mass-and area-based leaf N (N mass , N area) and leaf P concentrations (P mass , P area) and leaf chlorophyll concentration (SPAD) were measured for 92 woody plant species in two botanical gardens in China. The two gardens share plant species in common but differ in climate. Leaf trait variation between the two gardens was examined via mean comparison at three scales: all species together, species grouped into plant functional groups and within a species. A meta-analysis was performed to summarize the species-specific responses. Important Findings At the scale of all species together, LDMC, SLA, P mass and N mass were significantly lower in the dry-cold habitat than in the wet-warm one, whereas N area and SPAD showed an inverse pattern, indicating a significant environmental effect. The meta-analysis showed that the above-mentioned patterns persisted for SLA, N area and SPAD but not for the other variables at the species-specific scale, indicating that intraspecific variation affects the overall pattern of LDMC, P mass and N mass and P area. In terms of species-specific response, positive , negative or nonsignificant patterns were observed among the 92 species. Contrary to our prediction, species-specific responses within a functional group were not statistically more similar than those among functional groups. Our results indicated that leaf trait variation captured climatic difference yet species-specific responses were quite diverse irrespective of plant functional group, providing new insights for interpreting trait variability with climate.},

Urban greenspace can help mitigate the UHIE, but the characteristics that determine the extent to which any given greenspace can cool an urban area are not well understood. A key characteristic is likely to be the properties of trees that are found in a greenspace. Here, we explore the sensitivity of the strength of the cooling effect to tree community structure for greenspaces in Changzhou, China. Land surface temperatures were retrieved from Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 TIRS and were used to evaluate the temperature drop amplitude (TDA) and cooling range (CR) of 15 greenspaces across each of the four seasons. Tree community structure of the greenspaces was investigated using 156 sample plots across the 15 greenspaces. We found that a number of plant community structure indicators of greenspaces have a significant impact on the strength of the cooling effect. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index, tree species richness and tree canopy coverage of greenspaces are all positively correlated with the magnitude of the temperature drop amplitude, with the strength of their influence varying seasonally. We also find that mean crown width is positively correlated with cooling range in summer and autumn, while greenspace tree density is negatively correlated with cooling range in winter. Our findings improve understanding of the relationship between plant community structure and the cooling effect of greenspaces. In particular, we highlight the important role that tree species diversity provides for mitigating the UHIE, and suggest that if planners wish to improve the role of urban greenspaces in cooling cities, they should include a higher diversity of trees species.},

  abstract = {There is ample evidence that urban trees benefit the physical, mental, and social health of urban residents. The environmental justice hypothesis posits that environmental amenities are inequitably low in poor and minority communities, and predicts these communities experience fewer urban environmental benefits. Some previous research has found that urban forest cover is inequitably distributed by race, though other studies have found no relationship or negative inequity. These conflicting results and the single-city nature of the current literature suggest a need for a research synthesis. Using a systematic literature search and meta-analytic techniques, we examined the relationship between urban forest cover and race. First, we estimated the average (unconditional) relationship between urban forest cover and race across studies (studies = 40; effect sizes = 388). We find evidence of significant race-based inequity in urban forest cover. Second, we included characteristics of the original studies and study sites in meta-regressions to illuminate drivers of variation of urban forest cover between studies. Our meta-regressions reveal that the relationship varies across racial groups and by study methodology. Models reveal significant inequity on public land and that environmental and social characteristics of cities help explain variation across studies. As tree planting and other urban forestry programs proliferate, urban forestry professionals are encouraged to consider the equity consequences of urban forestry activities, particularly on public land.},

  abstract = {Vigilance increases fitness by improving predator detection but at the expense of increasing starvation risk. We related variation in vigilance among 122 radio-tagged overwintering grey partridges Perdix perdix (L.) across 20 independent farmland sites in England to predation risk (sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus L., kill rate), use of alternative antipredation behaviours (grouping and use of cover) and survival. Vigilance was significantly higher when individuals fed in smaller groups and in taller vegetation. In the covey period (in early winter when partridges are in flocks), vigilance and use of taller vegetation was significantly higher at sites with higher sparrowhawk predation risk, but tall vegetation was used less by larger groups. Individuals were constrained in reducing individual vigilance by group size and habitat choice because maximum group size was determined by overall density in the area during the covey period and by the formation of pairs at the end of the winter (pair period), when there was also a significant twofold increase in the use of tall cover. Over the whole winter individual survival was higher in larger groups and was lower in the pair period. However, when controlling for group size, mean survival decreased as vigilance increased in the covey period. This result, along with vigilance being higher at sites with increasing with raptor risk, suggests individual vigilance increases arose to reduce short-term predation risk from raptors but led to long-term fitness decreases probably because high individual vigilance increased starvation risk or indicated longer exposure to predation. The effect of raptors on survival was less when there were large groups in open habitats, where individual partridges can probably both detect predators and feed efficiently. Our study suggests that increasing partridge density and modifying habitat to remove the need for high individual vigilance may decrease partridge mortality. It demonstrates the general principle that antipredation behaviours may reduce fitness long-term via their effects on the starvation-predation risk trade-off, even though they decrease predation risk short-term, and that it may be ecological constraints, such as poor habitat (that lead to an antipredation behaviour compromising foraging), that cause mortality, rather than the proximate effect of an antipredation behaviour such as vigilance. \textcopyright{} 2006 The Authors.},

Individual variation in movement traits is an important axis of animal personality, particularly in the context of foraging ecology.

We quantified first-passage time and range-use ratio as proxies for movement-related foraging behavior and examined how these traits varied at the individual level across a foraging resource gradient. Our results suggest that individuals adjusted first-passage time but not range-use ratio to maximize access to high-quality foraging resources. First-passage time was repeatable, and intercepts for first-passage time and range-use ratio were negatively correlated. Individuals matched first-passage time but not range-use ratio to the expectations of our patch-use model that maximized access to foraging resources, a result that suggests that individuals ac-climated their movement patterns to accommodate both intra-and interannual variation in foraging resources on the landscape. Collectively , we highlight repeatable movement and space-use tactics and provide insight into how individual plasticity in movement interacts with landscape processes to affect the distribution of behavioral phenotypes and potentially fitness and population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Warming during late winter and spring in recent decades has been credited with increasing high northern latitude CO 2 uptake, but it is unclear how different species and plant functional types contribute to this response. To address this, we measured net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at a deciduous broadleaf (aspen and willow) forest and an evergreen conifer (black spruce) forest in interior Alaska over a 3-year period. We partitioned NEE into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R e) components, assessing the impact of interannual climate variability on these fluxes during spring and summer. We found that interannual variability in both spring and summer NEE was greatest at the deciduous forest. Increases in spring air temperatures between 2002 and 2004 caused GPP to increase during the early part of the growing season (April, May, and June), with a 74\% increase at the deciduous forest and a 16\% increase at the evergreen forest. R e increased in parallel, by 61\% and 15\%, respectively. In contrast, a summer drought during 2004 caused GPP during August to decrease by 12\% at the deciduous forest and by 9\% at the evergreen forest. Concurrent increases in R e , by 21\% and 2\% for the two forests, further contributed to a reduction in net carbon uptake during the drought. Over the growing season (April-September) net carbon uptake increased by 40\% at the deciduous forest and 3\% at the evergreen forest in 2004 as compared with 2002. These results suggest that deciduous forests may contribute disproportionately to variability in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations within the northern hemisphere and that the carbon balance of deciduous forests may have a greater sensitivity to future changes in climate.},

  abstract = {Although aquatic ecologists and biogeochemists are well aware of the crucial importance of ecosystem functions, i.e., how biota drive biogeochemical processes and vice-versa, linking these fields in conceptual models is still uncommon. Attempts to explain the variability in elemental cycling consequently miss an important biological component and thereby impede a comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes governing energy and matter flow and transformation. The fate of multiple chemical elements in ecosystems is strongly linked by biotic demand and uptake; thus, considering elemental stoichiometry is important for both biogeochemical and ecological research. Nonetheless, assessments of ecological stoichiometry (ES) often focus on the elemental content of biota rather than taking a more holistic view by examining both elemental pools and fluxes (e.g., organismal stoichiometry and ecosystem process rates). ES theory holds the promise to be a unifying concept to link across hierarchical scales of patterns and processes in ecology, but this has not been fully achieved. Therefore, we propose connecting the expertise of aquatic ecologists and biogeochemists with ES theory as a common currency to connect food webs, ecosystem metabolism, and biogeochemistry, as they are inherently concatenated by the transfer of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous through biotic and abiotic nutrient transformation and fluxes. Several new studies exist that demonstrate the connections between food web ecology, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem metabolism. In addition to a general introduction into the topic, this paper presents examples of how these fields can be combined with a focus on ES. In this review, a series of concepts have guided the discussion: 1) Changing biogeochemistry affects trophic interactions and ecosystem processes by altering the elemental ratios of key species and assemblages; 2) Changing trophic dynamics influences the transformation and fluxes of matter across environmental boundaries; 3) Changing ecosystem metabolism will alter the chemical diversity of the non-living environment. Finally, we propose that using ES to link nutrient cycling, trophic dynamics, and ecosystem metabolism would allow for a more holistic understanding of ecosystem functions in a changing environment.},

Small-scale experiments suggest potential ecosystem responses to losses of species, but definitive conclusions require verification at larger scales. We measured ecosystem metabolism and used whole-ecosystem stable isotope tracer additions to quantify nitrogen cycling in a tropical headwater stream before and after the sudden loss of amphibians to the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Tadpoles are normally dominant grazers in such streams, where greater than 18 species may co-occur and densities often exceed 50 individuals m-2. Loss of 98\% of tadpole biomass corresponded with greater than 2\texttimes{} increases in algae and fine detritus biomass in the stream and a greater than 50\% reduction in nitrogen uptake rate. Nitrogen turnover rates in suspended and deposited organic sediments were also significantly lower after the decline. As a consequence, the stream cycled nitrogen less rapidly, and downstream exports of particulate N were reduced. Whole stream respiration was significantly lower following the decline, indicating less biological activity in the stream sediments. Contrary to our predictions, biomass of grazing invertebrates, or any invertebrate functional groups, did not increase over 2 years following loss of tadpoles. Thus, reductions in ecosystem processes linked to the amphibian decline were not compensated for by other, functionally redundant consumers. Declining animal biodiversity has ecosystem-level consequences that may not be offset by ecological redundancy, even in biologically diverse regions such as the Neotropics.},

  abstract = {Central America hosts a diverse, unique, and imperiled amphibian fauna, and for decades Central America been a major epicenter of research into amphibian decline and conservation. In this critical and quantitative review, we synthesize current knowledge regarding amphibian decline and conservation in the seven countries that constitute Central America. There are 495 currently recognized amphibian species known from the region, distributed among the three extant orders, 16 families, and 69 genera\textemdash though description of new species continues to occur at a rapid pace. Central America's amphibian fauna is unique: 251 species are restricted to the region, and amphibian diversity varies among the major biogeographic provinces and climatic zones found in Central America. We use data generated by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to evaluate trends in extinction risk among Central American amphibians. As of 2014, there are 207 amphibian species considered threatened by the IUCN, and threat status varies according to taxonomic groupings, biogeographical association, elevation, and life history variables. Major threats to Central American amphibians include both conventional threats (habitat modification, habitat fragmentation, overharvesting, and invasive species) as well as emerging threats that operate on large spatial scales (pollution, emerging infectious diseases, UV-B radiation, and climate change). We conducted a quantitative literature review to document conservation research and to show trends in research activity. While the number of published studies on amphibian conservation increases each year, there are pronounced biogeographic biases in the distribution of published research, and most research is conducted by scientists at institutions outside of Central America with limited involvement of host-nation biologists in amphibian research. We synthesize empirical studies of conservation impacts to amphibians in Central America from habitat modification and fragmentation, overharvesting, invasive species, pollution, UV-B radiation, chytridiomycosis and other amphibian pathogens, climate change, and synergistic interactions among these threats. Much research in the past decade has focused on chytridiomycosis and the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), with far fewer studies on habitat modification, other amphibian pathogens, or climate change impacts to amphibians. We describe ongoing conservation actions for amphibians in the region, including monitoring, protected areas, captive assurance programs, protection of relict populations, reintroductions, and development of in-country capacity for research and conservation programs. We conclude with a list of priorities in research and conservation action for amphibians in the region.},

  abstract = {The amateur birding community has a long and proud tradition of contributing to bird surveys and bird atlases. Coordinated activities such as Breeding Bird Atlases and the Christmas Bird Count are examples of "citizen science" projects. With the advent of technology, Web 2.0 sites such as eBird have been developed to facilitate online sharing of data and thus increase the potential for real-time monitoring. However, as recently articulated in an editorial in this journal and elsewhere, monitoring is best served when based on a priori hypotheses. Harnessing citizen scientists to collect data following a hypothetico-deductive approach carries challenges. Moreover, the use of citizen science in scientific and monitoring studies has raised issues of data accuracy and quality. These issues are compounded when data collection moves into the Web 2.0 world. An examination of the literature from social geography on the concept of "citizen sensors" and volunteered geographic information (VGI) yields thoughtful reflections on the challenges of data quality/data accuracy when applying information from citizen sensors to research and management questions. VGI has been harnessed in a number of contexts, including for environmental and ecological monitoring activities. Here, I argue that conceptualizing a monitoring project as an experiment following the scientific method can further contribute to the use of VGI. I show how principles of experimental design can be applied to monitoring projects to better control for data quality of VGI. This includes suggestions for how citizen sensors can be harnessed to address issues of experimental controls and how to design monitoring projects to increase randomization and replication of sampled data, hence increasing scientific reliability and statistical power},

Dense ship traffic routes traverse this productive environment as vessels travel the Great Circle Route between Europe and North America. Oiled seabirds have washed up on beaches in Newfoundland for many decades. Most oil on their feathers is heavy fuel oil mixed with lubricants, the mixture found in bilges of large vessels. Beached bird surveys conducted between 1984 and 1999 indicate that chronic oil pollution along the southeast coast of Newfoundland is among the highest in world. Sixty two percent of all dead birds found over the 16-year period had oil on their feathers; 74\% during the last five years. Auks, especially Thick-billed Murres (Uria lomvia), are the most affected. The mean number of oiled birds per kilometer was 0.77 and thus higher than in other regions of the world during a comparable time period (0.02-0.33). Oiling rates correlated with weather patterns and degree of the regional murre hunt, indicate that illegal dumping of oil may occur year round, and point out that it is critical to assess all possible environmental and anthropogenic factors influencing the number of clean and oiled dead birds found on beaches before inferring trends in oiling rates over time. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Hibernating bats with white-nose syndrome (WNS) show a number of unusual behaviours including increased frequency of arousal from torpor, altered roosting behaviour and premature emergence. However, mechanisms underlying these patterns are not understood, and the behaviour of bats with WNS has not been examined systematically. Three hypotheses could explain increased arousal frequency. Bats may arouse to (1) groom in response to skin infection, (2) drink to offset dehydration or (3) increase activity, possibly in an attempt to access resources, avoid a source of infection or limit the risk of infecting relatives. We tested these hypotheses with captive little brown bats, Myotis lucifugus, inoculated with Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the fungus that causes WNS. In contrast to predictions of all three hypotheses, bats inoculated with the fungus tended to be less active than controls during arousals from torpor and did not increase grooming or visits to the water source in their enclosures. However, bats showed a dramatic reduction in clustering behaviour as infection progressed. Reduced activity and clustering could represent adaptive, maladaptive or pathological responses. Reduced activity could be an energy-saving mechanism or a pathological consequence of infection while reduced clustering could have beneficial or detrimental consequences for transmission, energetics, water balance and survival. Our results highlight the need for studies of host behaviour to understand dynamics of wildlife infectious diseases.},

Trait values affect how plants function, with consequences that propagate through scales of ecological organization to affect ecosystem function. However, the pathway connecting trait expression to ecosystem function is complicated by feedbacks: trait expression may vary within species in response to community diversity, and trait expression also determines a community's functional diversity. The predictability and consequences of interactions between trait expression and community diversity are poorly understood, particularly in forest ecosystems. 2. Here we quantify the extent to which light access-which past studies suggest affects trait expression and differs as a result of interactions among plants-differs consistently with community diversity and explains intraspecific trait variation in trees. In a common garden, trees of five angiosperm and seven gymnosperm species were planted to form 37 communities ranging widely in species and functional diversity whereby confounding environmental variation was minimized. We sampled leaves of each species to characterize intraspecific variation within and among communities in three traits-leaf size, specific leaf area and nitrogen concentration and estimated each leaf's access to light. 3. We found that light access explained a substantial portion of trait variation within all species, species tended to receive less light in more diverse communities and effects of community diversity on trait expression tended to be mediated by light. 4. Synthesis. This study shows that community diversity affects leaf trait plasticity in young trees through its effects on light availability. Moreover, trait responses across angiosperms and gymnosperms were remarkably similar, showing that shared biophysical constraints overwhelm divergent evolutionary histories. Together, these results illustrate how leaf trait expression responds to, and may subsequently shape, diversity in young tree communities in largely predictable ways via resource-based interactions, with consequences that may scale from individuals to ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Prey species use structures such as burrows to minimize predation risk. The spatial arrangement of these resources can have important implications for individual and population fitness. For example, there is evidence that clustered resources can benefit individuals by reducing predation risk and increasing foraging opportunity concurrently, which leads to higher population density. However, the scale of clustering that is important in these processes has been ignored during theoretical and empirical development of resource models. Ecological understanding of refuge exploitation by prey can be improved by spatial analysis of refuge use and availability that incorporates the effect of scale. We measured the spatial distribution of pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis) refugia (burrows) through censuses in four 6-ha sites. Point pattern analyses were used to evaluate burrow selection by comparing the spatial distribution of used and available burrows. The presence of food resources and additional overstory cover resources was further examined using logistic regression. Burrows were spatially clustered at scales up to approximately 25 m, and then regularly spaced at distances beyond 40 m. Pygmy rabbit exploitation of burrows did not match availability. Burrows used by pygmy rabbits were likely to be located in areas with high overall burrow density (resource clusters) and high overstory cover, which together minimized predation risk. However, in some cases we observed an interaction between either overstory cover (safety) or understory cover (forage) and burrow density. The interactions show that pygmy rabbits will use burrows in areas with low relative burrow density (high relative predation risk) if understory food resources are high. This points to a potential trade-off whereby rabbits must sacrifice some safety afforded by additional nearby burrows to obtain ample forage resources. Observed patterns of clustered burrows and non-random burrow use improve understanding of the importance of spatial distribution of refugia for burrowing herbivores. The analyses used allowed for the estimation of the spatial scale where subtle trade-offs between predation avoidance and foraging opportunity are likely to occur in a natural system.

Yet, the net balance of MeHg sources and sinks in seasonal wetland environments is poorly understood because it requires an annual, integrated assessment across biota, sediment, and water components. We examined a suite of wetlands managed for rice crops or wildlife during 2007-2008 in California's Central Valley, in an area affected by Hg contamination from historic mining practices. Hydrologic management of agricultural wetlands for rice, wild rice, or fallowed - drying for field preparation and harvest, and flooding for crop growth and post-harvest rice straw decay - led to pronounced seasonality in sediment and aqueous MeHg concentrations that were up to 95-fold higher than those measured concurrently in adjacent, non-agricultural permanently-flooded and seasonally-flooded wetlands. Flooding promoted microbial MeHg production in surface sediment of all wetlands, but extended water residence time appeared to preferentially enhance MeHg degradation and storage. When incoming MeHg loads were elevated, individual fields often served as a MeHg sink, rather than a source. Slow, horizontal flow of shallow water in the agricultural wetlands led to increased importance of vertical hydrologic fluxes, including evapoconcentration of surface water MeHg and transpiration-driven advection into the root zone, promoting temporary soil storage of MeHg. Although this hydrology limited MeHg export from wetlands, it also increased MeHg exposure to resident fish via greater in situ aqueous MeHg concentrations. Our results suggest that the combined traits of agricultural wetlands - slow-moving shallow water, manipulated flooding and drying, abundant labile plant matter, and management for wildlife - may enhance microbial methylation of Hg(II) and MeHg exposure to local biota, as well as export to downstream habitats during uncontrolled winter-flow events. \textcopyright{} 2014 .},

We studied oviposition sites used by a population of Leucorrhinia intacta dragonflies at a small pond near Syracuse, NY, USA. Females preferentially used shallow water as an oviposition habitat. Shallow water increases egg hatching rate through temperature effects on development time and reduces predation on the female. Use of shallow water areas was reduced by locally high densities of territorial males. The same oviposition sites probably maximized the fitness of the male, female, and offspring, meaning that site selection did not necessitate fitness tradeoffs among these classes of individuals. Pond sectors used by ovipositing females were significantly correlated within and between years, but not within days or between consecutive days. Use of pond sectors within and between days was not related to the relative availability of the shallow water habitat, while seasonal use of pond sectors was related positively to availability of shallow water. In spite of the preference by females for ovipositing in shallow water, short-term location of females was not predictable and males could not search predictably good areas during a day. However, across a season, areas with more shallow water available were used for oviposition more than areas with limited substrate.},

Consequently, reconciliation remains an elusive concept. Here we outline 10 Calls to Action to natural scientists to enable reconciliation in their work.

Our 10 Calls to Action are triggered by frustration. The authors have witnessed examples where natural scientists treat Indigenous communities with blatant disrespect or with ignorance of Indigenous rights.

  abstract = {Urban sustainability is one of the most pressing and challenging tasks facing humanity today because cities are the primary sources of major environmental problems, the centers of economic and social developments, and home to more than half of the world population. While the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of sustainability are equally important in principle, the ecology of cities is arguably least studied. But this situation has been changing rapidly in recent years. In this paper, the author compares and contrasts different perspectives in urban ecology and examines their relevance to urban sustainability. While all perspectives are useful in some ways, the author argues, a landscape ecology perspective that integrates elements of sustainability science seems most comprehensive and effective. This integrative perspective views humans as powerful "ecosystem engineers" or agents that are critically important for developing urban sustainability. It focuses on the human landscape scale that is large enough to include key ecological and socioeconomic processes and small enough to allow for detailed mechanistic studies. The landscape ecology approach also emphasizes the interrelationship between urban landscape patterns and ecological/socioeconomic processes on different scales, and encourages place based research that integrates ecology with planning, design, and other social sciences.},

  abstract = {The net ecosystem exchange of CO 2 (NEE) between the atmosphere and a temperate beech forest showed a significant interannual variation (IAV) and a decadal trend of increasing carbon uptake (Pilegaard et al., 2011). The objectives of this study were to evaluate to what extent and at which temporal scale, direct climatic variability and changes in ecosystem functional properties regulated the IAV of the carbon balance at this site. Correlation analysis showed that the sensitivity of carbon fluxes to climatic variability was significantly higher at shorter than at longer time scales and changed seasonally. Ecosystem response anomalies implied that changes in the distribution of climate anomalies during the vegetation period will have stronger impacts on future ecosystem carbon balances than changes in average climate. We improved a published modelling approach which distinguishes the direct climatic effects from changes in ecosystem functioning (Richardson et al., 2007) by employing the semi empirical model published by Lasslop et al. (2010b). Fitting the model in short moving windows enabled large flexibility to adjust the parameters to the seasonal course of the ecosystem functional state. At the annual time scale as much as 80 \% of the IAV in NEE was attributed to the variation in photosynthesis and respiration related model parameters. Our results suggest that the observed decadal NEE trend at the investigated site was dominated by changes in ecosystem functioning. In general this study showed the importance of understanding the mechanisms of ecosystem functional change. Incorporating ecosystem functional change into process based models will reduce the uncertainties in long-term predictions of ecosystem carbon balances in global climate change projections.},

All the components and their relationships are influenced profoundly by the speed and spatiotemporal pattern of urbanization that is driven primarily by socioeconomic processes. Thus, understanding and improving the ecology and sustainability of urban landscapes and regions should not only consider how urbanization affects these key components but also how their relationships change in time. Human well-being is the primary focus for urban sustainability projects, whereas urban ecological studies often focus on biodiversity, ecological processes, and ecosystem services. In either case, the connections among the key components and their linkages across spatial (landscape-region-globe) and temporal (year-decade-century) scales should be taken into account. a b s t r a c t Ecosystems and landscapes around the world have become increasingly domesticated through urbanization. Cities have been the engines of socioeconomic development but also the centers of major environmental problems since the industrial revolution. Numerous studies have shown that our urban ecosystems and landscapes are on an unsustainable trajectory. Global sustainability depends critically on cities, and urban ecology can-and needs to-play a key role in the transition toward sustainability. In this paper, I review different definitions and perspectives of urban ecology, discuss major advances and key issues, and propose a framework to help move the field forward. After almost 90 years of development, urban ecology has evolved into a truly transdisciplinary enterprise that integrates ecological, geographical , planning, and social sciences. The most salient thrust of current research activities in the field is the emerging urban sustainability paradigm which focuses on urban ecosystem services and their relations to human well-being. While urbanization is complex in many ways, we do know a lot about its patterns, processes, and effects. More specifically, we know a great deal about urban growth patterns in space and time, the underlying drivers and mechanisms, and myriad effects of urbanization on biodiversity, ecological processes, and ecosystem services. Compared to their ancient counterparts, contemporary cities tend to be bigger in physical size and ecological footprint, faster in growth rate in terms of both population and urbanized land, and more irregular in landscape composition and configuration. As coevolving human-environment systems, cities are spatially heterogeneous, complex adaptive systems. As such, the dynamic trajectory of cities can never be fully predicted or controlled, but can and should be influenced or guided in more desirable directions through planning and design activities that are based on urban ecological knowledge and sustainability principles.},

Given the complexity of urban areas, relationships among variables that cause stream degradation can be diffi-cult to isolate. We examined factors affecting stream condition by evaluating social, terrestrial, stream hydrology and water quality variables from 20 urban stream watersheds in central Iowa, U.S.A. We used path analysis to examine and quantify social and ecological factors related to variation in stream condi-tions. Path models supported hypotheses that stream water quality was influenced by variables in each category. Specifically, one path model indicated that increased stream water conductivity was linked to high road density, which itself was associated with high human population density. A second path model revealed nitrogen concentration in stream water was positively related to watershed area covered by cropland, and that cropland increased as human population density declined. A third path model indi-cated phosphorus concentration in stream water declined as percent of watershed residents with college education increased, although the mechanism underlying this relationship was unclear and could have been an artifact of lower soil-derived nutrient input from watersheds dominated by paved surfaces. To improve environmental conditions in urban streams, land use planning strategies should include limiting or reducing road density near streams, installing treatment trains for surface water runoff associated with roads, and establishing vegetated buffer zones to reduce inputs of road salt and other pollutants. Addi-tionally, education/outreach should be conducted with residents to increase understanding of how their own behaviors influence stream water quality.},

For the temperate lakes, the proportion of the lake perimeter and the proportion of the watershed occupied by wetlands were the best predictors of DOC in both univariate (r(2) = 0.34 and 0.30, respectively) and multivariate regression models. Forested wetlands, in particular those with coniferous vegetation, explained the largest proportion of lake DOC variability. Wetlands with scrub-shrubs and emergent vegetation explained very little or no variability. Secondary to wetlands, lake DOC decreased with lake area and watershed slope. When we combined the temperate lake data set with that of 10 other geographical regions of the world (ranging from subtropical to tundra), the only two variables significant in predicting DOC were proportion of wetlands in the watershed (r(2) = 0.36) and lake elevation (r(2) = 0.34). We conclude that regional or small-scale DOC models likely have limited applicability in predicting DOC in other geographical areas of the world.},

The results show that highly gendered ecosystem services include medicinal products from forest or mangrove ecosystems and freshwater supply. Women have a stronger perception of water quality and erosion control, soil formation, habitat conservation and sustaining biodiversity. Men, on the other hand, had more knowledge of fuel and timber and extreme event mitigation services. Our review also identifies the limitations of sample size for this interdisciplinary topic, calls for more case studies and comparative studies to identify relationships between gender and ecosystem service perceptions, and calls for the development of models on ecosystem services that incorporate gender. Finally, we discuss how our review can augment existing gender frameworks for policymaking.},

In this study, we sampled current-year twigs of 335 tree species from 12 forest sites across a latitudinal span of 32 degrees in China, and measured twig specific density (TSD), twig dry matter content (TDMC), and carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) contents , to explore the latitudinal and environmental patterns of these twig traits. The overall mean of TSD and TDMC was 0.37 g cm -3 and 41\%, respectively; mean twig C, N and P was 472 mg g -1 , 9.8 mg g -1 and 1.15 mg g -1 , respectively, and mean N:P mass ratio was 10.6. TSD was positively correlated with TDMC which was positively associated with twig C but negatively with twig N and P. There were no significant differences in TSD between conifer, deciduous-broadleaf and evergreen-broadleaf plants, but evergreen-broadleaf plants had the lowest and conifers the highest TDMC. Conifer twigs were lowest in C, N, P and N:P, whereas deciduous-plant twigs were highest in N and P and evergreen-plant twigs were highest in C and N:P. As latitude increased or temperature/precipitation dropped, TDMC and P increased, but N:P ratio decreased. Our results also showed that the patterns of twig P and N:P stoichiometry were consistent with those reported for leaves, but no significant trends in twig N were observed along the gradient of latitude, climate and soils. This study provides the first large-scale patterns of the twig traits and will improve our understanding of the biogeochemistry of carbon and other key nutrients in forest ecosystems.},

Recently, the soaring demand for oil and the availability of modern bitumen extraction technology have heightened exploitation of this reservoir and the potential unintended consequences of pollution in the Athabasca River. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential impacts of oil sands mining on neighboring aquatic microbial community structure. Microbial communities were sampled from sediments in the Athabasca River and its tributaries as well as in oil sands tailings ponds. Bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified and sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology (454 and Ion Torrent). Sediments were also analyzed for a variety of chemical and physical characteristics. Microbial communities in the fine tailings of the tailings ponds were strikingly distinct from those in the Athabasca River and tributary sediments. Microbial communities in sediments taken close to tailings ponds were more similar to those in the fine tailings of the tailings ponds than to the ones from sediments further away. Additionally, bacterial diversity was significantly lower in tailings pond sediments. Several taxonomic groups of Bacteria and Archaea showed significant correlations with the concentrations of different contaminants, highlighting their potential as bioindicators. We also extensively validated Ion Torrent sequencing in the context of environmental studies by comparing Ion Torrent and 454 data sets and by analyzing control samples.},

On site bioremediation of contaminated soil is the only feasible clean up solution in these remote areas, but degradation rates vary widely between bioremediation treatments. Most previous studies have focused on the feasibility of on site clean-up and very little attention has been given to the microbial and functional communities involved and their ecology. Here, we ask the question: which microorganisms and functional genes are abundant and active during hydrocarbon degradation at cold temperature? To answer this question, we sequenced the soil metagenome of an ongoing bioremediation project in Alert, Canada through a time course. We also used reverse-transcriptase real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) to quantify the expression of several hydrocarbon-degrading genes. Pseudomonas species appeared as the most abundant organisms in Alert soils right after contamination with diesel and excavation (t = 0) and one month after the start of the bioremediation treatment (t = 1m), when degradation rates were at their highest, but decreased after one year (t = 1y), when residual soil hydrocarbons were almost depleted. This trend was also reflected in hydrocarbon degrading genes, which were mainly affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria at t = 0 and t = 1m and with Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria at t = 1y. RT-qPCR assays confirmed that Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus species actively expressed hydrocarbon degradation genes in Arctic biopile soils. Taken together, these results indicated that biopile treatment leads to major shifts in soil microbial communities, favoring aerobic bacteria that can degrade hydrocarbons.},

Biofilms exposed to sediments having low and high concentrations of bituminous compounds were compared. The latter were 29\% thinner, had a different extracellular polysaccharide composition, 67\% less bacterial biomass per {$\mu$}m2, 68\% less cyanobacterial biomass per {$\mu$}m2, 64\% less algal biomass per {$\mu$}m2, 13\% fewer protozoa per cm2, were 21\% less productive, and had a 33\% reduced content in chlorophyll a per mm2 and a 20\% reduction in the expression of photosynthetic genes, but they had a 23\% increase in the expression of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation genes. Within the Bacteria, differences in community composition were also observed, with relatively more Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria and less Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes in biofilms exposed to high concentrations of bituminous compounds. Altogether, our results suggest that biofilms that develop in the presence of higher concentrations of bituminous compounds are less productive and have lower biomass, linked to a decrease in the activities and abundance of photosynthetic organisms likely due to inhibitory effects. However, within this general inhibition, some specific microbial taxa and functional genes are stimulated because they are less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of bituminous compounds or can degrade and utilize some bitumen-associated compounds.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully.

About half the global wetland area has been lost, but an international treaty (the 1971 Ramsar Convention) has helped 144 nations protect the most significant remaining wetlands. Because most nations lack wetland inventories, changes in the quantity and quality of the world's wetlands cannot be tracked adequately. Despite the likelihood that remaining wetlands occupy less than 9\% of the earth's land area, they contribute more to annually renewable ecosystem services than their small area implies. Biodi-versity support, water quality improvement, flood abatement, and carbon sequestration are key functions that are impaired when wetlands are lost or degraded. Restoration techniques are improving, although the recovery of lost biodiversity is challenged by invasive species, which thrive under disturbance and displace natives. Not all dam-ages to wetlands are reversible, but it is not always clear how much can be retained through restoration. Hence, we recommend adaptive approaches in which alternative techniques are tested at large scales in actual restoration sites.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem service (ES) mapping frequently uses secondary data and value-transfer methods to map services over broad extents at coarse resolutions, possibly causing poor prediction accuracy. Although ES map quality has received some recent attention in the literature, little is known about the accuracy of these maps in urban contexts or about the factors that influence this accuracy. To address this issue, we quantitatively compared and validated ES maps in a heterogeneous urban landscape to generate insight into ES map accuracy in these environments. Using aboveground biomass carbon storage as an example, we examined how input data resolution and assessment method affect the accuracy of urban ES maps. Two mapping methods were employed: (1) maps based on ecosystem components involved in carbon storage (trees and lawns) and (2) maps based on land-cover proxies and data at coarse and fine spatial resolutions. We compared carbon storage predicted by these methods to that estimated by using field-collected data to examine the accuracy of predictions and spatial variation therein. Different methods and data produced similar study area-wide estimates; however, the spatial distribution of estimates varied among methods. Estimates using ecosystem components agreed with the actual observations better than the proxy-based estimates, although map accuracy was improved by using higher resolution land-cover data. Thus, when study area-wide estimates suffice for decision making, proxy-based methods and coarse-resolution data should provide adequate assessments. Detailed ecosystem structure and composition data are needed when fine-resolution, spatially-explicit estimates are required.},

  year = {1995},
  abstract = {We assert that researchers should use statistics derived from the linear distances between actual and estimated locations of test transmitters to estimate location error in radiotelemetry data. We call this approach the location error method. We used the distribution of such linear distances from a test data set from a study on black bears (Ursus americanus) in the mountains of North Carolina to predict error statistics for another test data set. We then compared the predicted with the actual error statistics. We also predicted error statistics for the second test data set using the error polygon method and Lenth's maximum likelihood estimator method. Linear and areal predictions of error using the location error method closely matched actual error in the second data set. The 90\% confidence area calculated from test data contained 90\% of the actual locations. The linear error measures taken from the error polygon method averaged twice the length of the 90\% confidence distances generated from test data, and the 90\% error polygons actually contained 95 \% of the true locations. The 95 \% confidence ellipse of Lenth's maximum likelihood estimator method (f = 50 ha) was also a poor indicator of the precision of the actual location errors (95th percentile = 187 ha). Investigators should use bearing analysis on known locations only to find and correct biases in the bearing data prior to triangulation.

  abstract = {Improved landscape connectivity is increasingly considered a viable management strategy to maintain biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and services. How landscape structure affects biodiversity, ecosystem services, and their relationship, however, is still unclear in many cases, including the service of climate regulation. The effects of forest fragmentation on carbon storage remain largely unknown, compounded by uncertainty in both the direction and magnitude of the relationship between carbon storage and biodiversity. We investigated the effects of forest fragmentation and management on carbon stocks and biodiversity in the Mont\'er\'egie, QC. We quantified total aboveground carbon stocks in 24 small forest fragments of two sizes ({$\sim$}10 ha, {$\sim$}100 ha), and two levels of connectivity, using a combination of satellite data, field-based methods, and allometry. We correlated this data with both woody plant species richness and functional dispersion to determine the relationship between biodiversity and carbon stocks in these forest fragments. We found functional dispersion was a significant predictor of aboveground carbon stocks, interacting with forest management and connectivity in this fragmented forest system. Both synergies and tradeoffs between biodiversity and carbon stocks were observed. Unmanaged forest stands stored less carbon on average than managed, but demonstrated a significant positive relationship between functional dispersion and aboveground carbon stocks, corroborating the results of biodiversity-ecosystem function experiments. The slope of the relationship was significantly greater in connected fragments than isolated, suggesting improved forest connectivity may strengthen the relationship between biodiversity and aboveground carbon stocks in this region. Managed stands exhibited a significant negative relationship, demonstrating that anthropogenic influence can alter the link between biodiversity and carbon stocks in natural systems. Our results suggest that considering management, connectivity, and functional diversity may increase accuracy in estimating landscape level carbon stocks. Additionally, the significant contributions of small forest fragments to regional diversity and service provision emphasizes the important role these fragments can play in conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {By 2050, up to 75\% of people globally will live in cities. Despite the potential ramifications of this urbanization for ecosystem services (ES), and the importance of locally produced ES for the health and wellbeing of urban residents, syntheses addressing the underlying ecology of ES provision rarely include urban areas. Here, I conduct a quantitative review of urban ES studies in the ecological literature, synthesizing trends across the discipline. I also quantify the extent to which this work considers the organisms and ecosystem components responsible for ES provision using two approaches: assessment of biodiversity\textendash ES relationships, and an adaptation of the service provider concept. The majority of urban ES studies were conducted in western, developed countries, and typically assessed a single service in a single city \textendash{} largely ignoring ES synergies and tradeoffs, and cross-city comparisons. While several different ES are studied in urban ecosystems, the field is dominated by weather and climate-related regulating services, with assessments of cultural services particularly lacking. Most studies described a habitat type as the service provider; however, studies that considered the biodiversity\textendash ES relationship were more likely to identify a specific functional group, community, or population as the key provider of an ES. The biodiversity\textendash ES relationship itself was most frequently characterized as dependent on the composition of species, functional traits, or structures, rather than correlated with the magnitude of any specific biodiversity metric. While the study of ES in urban ecosystems is increasing, there exists considerable room for further research. Future studies would benefit by expanding the number and categories of ES assessed within and across cities, as well as broadening the geographical scope of urban ES research. Biodiversity\textendash ES assessments in urban ecosystems would also benefit from an expansion of the biodiversity types considered, particularly regarding non-species based approaches, and consideration of non-native and invasive species. Synthesis Urban ecosystem services (ES) affect the health and wellbeing of over 3.5 billion people who live in cities. However, syntheses addressing ES provision rarely include urban areas. I conducted the first quantitative review focused explicitly on the ecology of urban ES, including the role of biodiversity in service provision. I found that studies typically measure only a single service in one city, precluding assessment of ES synergies, tradeoffs, and cross-city comparisons. I also found that while most studies attribute ES provision to a habitat or land-use type, studies that consider biodiversity-ES relationships are more likely to recognize a specific functional group, community, or population as the key provider of an ES.},

  abstract = {Urban landscapes are increasingly recognized as providing important ecosystem services (ES) to their occupants. Yet, urban ES assessments often ignore the complex spatial heterogeneity and land-use history of cities. Soil-based services may be particularly susceptible to land-use legacy effects. We studied indicators of three soil-based ES, carbon storage, water quality regulation, and runoff regulation, in a historically agricultural urban landscape and asked (1) How do ES indicators vary with contemporary land cover and time since development? (2) Do ES indicators vary primarily among land-cover classes, within land-cover classes, or within sites? (3) What is the relative contribution of urban land-cover classes to potential citywide ES provision? We measured biophysical indicators (soil carbon [C], available phosphorus [P], and saturated hydraulic conductivity [Ks]) in 100 sites across five land-cover classes, spanning an 125-year gradient of time since development within each land-cover class. Potential for ES provision was substantial in urban green spaces, including developed land. Runoff regulation services (high Ks) were highest in forests; water quality regulation (low P) was highest in open spaces and grasslands; and open spaces and developed land (e.g., residential yards) had the highest C storage. In developed land covers, both C and P increased with time since development, indicating effects of historical land-use on contemporary ES and trade-offs between two important ES. Among-site differences accounted for a high proportion of variance in soil properties in forests, grasslands, and open space, while residential areas had high within-site variability, underscoring the leverage city residents have to improve urban ES provision. Developed land covers contributed most ES supply at the citywide scale, even after accounting for potential impacts of impervious surfaces. Considering the full mosaic of urban green space and its history is needed to estimate the kinds and magnitude of ES provided in cities, and to augment regional ES assessments that often ignore or underestimate urban ES supply.},

  abstract = {As cities warm and the need for climate adaptation strategies increases, a more detailed understanding of the cooling effects of land cover across a continuum of spatial scales will be necessary to guide management decisions. We asked how tree canopy cover and impervious surface cover interact to influence daytime and nighttime summer air temperature, and how effects vary with the spatial scale at which land-cover data are analyzed (10-, 30-, 60-, and 90-m radii). A bicycle-mounted measurement system was used to sample air temperature every 5 m along 10 transects ({$\sim$}7 km length, sampled 3\textendash 12 times each) spanning a range of impervious and tree canopy cover (0\textendash 100\%, each) in a midsized city in the Upper Midwest United States. Variability in daytime air temperature within the urban landscape averaged 3.5 \textdegree C (range, 1.1\textendash 5.7 \textdegree C). Temperature decreased nonlinearly with increasing canopy cover, with the greatest cooling when canopy cover exceeded 40\%. The magnitude of daytime cooling also increased with spatial scale and was greatest at the size of a typical city block (60\textendash 90 m). Daytime air temperature increased linearly with increasing impervious cover, but the magnitude of warming was less than the cooling associated with increased canopy cover. Variation in nighttime air temperature averaged 2.1 \textdegree C (range, 1.2\textendash 3.0 \textdegree C), and temperature increased with impervious surface. Effects of canopy were limited at night; thus, reduction of impervious surfaces remains critical for reducing nighttime urban heat. Results suggest strategies for managing urban land-cover patterns to enhance resilience of cities to climate warming.},

Predicting such risks is critical when designing disease mitigation strategies, and especially as regards wildlife, where intensive management is often advocated or prevented by economic and/or practical reasons. We investigated Pseudogymnoascus [Geomyces] destructans infection, the cause of white-nose syndrome (WNS), in relation to chiropteran ecology, behaviour and phylogenetics. While this fungus has caused devastating declines in North American bat populations, there have been no apparent population changes attributable to the disease in Europe. We screened 276 bats of 15 species from hibernacula in the Czech Republic over 2012 and 2013, and provided histopathological evidence for 11 European species positive for WNS. With the exception of Myotis myotis, the other ten species are all new reports for WNS in Europe. Of these, M. emarginatus, Eptesicus nilssonii, Rhinolophus hipposideros, Barbastella barbastellus and Plecotus auritus are new to the list of P. destructans-infected bat species. While the infected species are all statistically phylogenetically related, WNS affects bats from two suborders. These are ecologically diverse and adopt a wide range of hibernating strategies. Occurrence of WNS in distantly related bat species with diverse ecology suggests that the pathogen may be a generalist and that all bats hibernating within the distribution range of P. destructans may be at risk of infection.},
